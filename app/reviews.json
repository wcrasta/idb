The game is based on figuring out various secrets and different weaknesses of enemies, and will play with your patience if you rush through it. It’s not a game for everyone. The most important thing to remember is this, take your time and figure things out. You will be frustrated during some fights but when you finally win that tough boss fight after 5, 10, 20, or even more tries, you will feel a true sense of achievement.\r\n\r\n", "updated_at": 1400241875912, "positive_points": ">Rich and detailed world\r\n>Fun and challenging multiplayer\r\n>Diverse and spectacular boss fights\r\n>Rewarding combat system", "content": "Prepare to die, die, repeat. This short little recipe is something that you will encounter very often in “Dark Souls”. “Dark Souls” is a role playing game in which you play as an undead journeying through the unforgiving dungeons and forests of Lordran, a land filled with skeletons, zombies, ghosts, fiery demons from the very pits of hell, tormented souls of long lost warriors, and many more. The land is dying and it is up to you to save it, although that might not be very clear to you. “Dark Souls” doesn’t hold your hand nor does it give any detailed guidance, it just gives you vague information on where you are supposed to go and lets you on your way, which might not be very appealing for less hardcore newcomers. The game tells you a short little backstory at the beginning to set the mood and it is up to you to figure out the rest of the lore through short dialogues with rare sane NPCs and by reading little bits and pieces of lore from item descriptions. \r\n\r\nThe story isn’t the only thing you aren’t given on a silver platter, the combat can be very difficult if you do not take your time and carefully analyze your enemies and the situation at hand. If you don’t you will find yourself having to backtrack quite a bit since checkpoints are fairly limited. The controls may take some time to get used to  The first few hours of playtime will be the most difficult as you get accustomed to the controls and the combat itself, but do not falter, as the game progresses, and as you acquire new skills and items, not to mention learn a few neat tricks, you will feel much more empowered and, with enough practice, cut down your foes with ease. \r\n\r\nThe game itself can be very lengthy, depending on your skill and the amount of exploration you put into it. Personally my first playthrough took me about 45 hours, and if you feel that is too short, the game offers you the ability to play again in “New Game+” in which you keep all your current equipment and level and start again with harder enemies, although I found the game to actually be easier on NG+, well except for the bosses, which were still hard as hell, but that's all part of the fun.\r\n\r\nIf you see it, you can visit it. Visually the game is something to marvel at. Not only are the visuals very detailed and rich, the atmosphere is just superb, and the level design is one of the best I have seen in some open RPGs. Everything is beautifully and logically connected to each other, which isn’t the case for some other RPGS. The game doesn’t offer you an in game map but don’t worry because you won’t need it. Even if you don’t have a good sense of orientation in game spaces, you won’t have any problems finding your way through the game. \r\n\r\nYou are not alone. “Dark Souls” offers a very useful and challenging multiplayer mode, which is active while you play the singleplayer story. Let me explain. When you play your game and are online you will be able to find little notes left behind by other players, these notes can offer you short tips on how to prepare for what’s ahead or they could just be outright lying to you. Additionally you can see ghostly apparitions of other players every once in awhile when you are roaming through Lordran. If a player dies you can find their bloodstain left at the scene of the incident, then you can click on it to view the death of said player, cryptic. But the most important part of the multiplayer is summoning and invasions. Lets start with invasions. Any player can invade any other players’ game. When you are invaded you will be given a warning that another player has invaded you, they will then appear as a ghostly red apparition. It is then up to you to fight of the enemy invader, or die, depends on how good you are. Although it can be a bit of bitch if haven’t practiced your parry and riposte, which are a good way to ease up the combat if you can get the hand of it. The second part of the multiplayer is more cooperative, summoning. Any player can summon another player via soapstone’s, this feature can be used to help your friends out with difficult boss fights, or they can help you in the same way. \r\n", "likes": 2, "slug": "prepare-to-die-die-repeat", "introduction": "\"Dark Souls\", an open worldish RPG developed by \"From Software\", released in 2011.", "platform": 12, "created_at": 1399547260430, "negative_points": ">Targeting system can pose problems\r\n>Difficulty won't appeal to most players\r\n>Unforgiving PVP invaders can be a real pain", "id": 8, "game": 2155, "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dark-souls/reviews/prepare-to-die-die-repeat", "rating_category": 2, "username": "Kalipto"}, {"title": "It was good but it could have been great", "views": 187, "category": 1, "conclusion": "Overall though, it was loads of fun.

From recovery attacks, to special and basic attacks, to assist trophies, and bubble shields. Even lots of little things. Final smashes and Chowder had the cook ability just like Kirby. In SSB you can throw a Pokeball and have Wobbuffet flail around. Shnitzel from Chowder did the same thing. It's not bad that it did that. But they did forget a few things. Like when you're fighting an enemy, it shows your characters damage counter and lives. But it doesn't show the enemies.

However, there are these extra shooter challenges and it's difficult because they made it a pain just to aim and shoot. But going back to the standard fighting part. That was very difficult as well. Which is great. A game should make someone rage because of it's challenging. Even if it is Cartoon Network.\r\n\r\nThey also forgot a few characters. For a Cartoon Network game, they needed to at least have Johnny Bravo and Courage the Cowardly Dog. Those two were some very successful characters in the Cartoon Network community. Johnny Bravo was at least an assist trophy. But no reference at all to Courage. Or Ed, Edd, & Eddy, and Camp Lazlo.

The island is full of dangers and it is up to Lara to face them, find her friends and escape the island. As you may have already known “Tomb Raider” takes place as a prequel, this being Lara’s first “real” adventure. So this opened up possibilities for greater character development for Lara since little was known of her beginnings before. And it starts out very well actually, we see Lara for what she is at the moment, an actual frightened human being, who was thrown into a situation she didn’t even ask for. She just wants this nightmare to end. At one point she is caught in a trap and has to fight off hungry wolves using only her bow and arrow, the entire sequence is quite intense and fun. She is even thrown into a situation where she has to kill a man in self-defense, which would be a terrible and traumatizing event for anyone. In Lara’s case that event lasted only one cutscene, and after that here comes a shitload of killing sprees. This was the point when the character development just goes down the toilet. There is no transition from “oh, god… what have I done” to “COME AND GET ME YOU BASTARDS!”, yeah very subtle transformation, didn’t even notice it, did you? The jump from self-defense to outright murder is just way to quick to be realistic. There is even a scene where Lara has to jump into a river of blood to escape her captors, when she emerges there isn’t even a whimper on her side, she just shrugs it off. The character development was the main grudge I had with the whole narrative department, \r\nI didn’t even mind the basic plot, to be honest I wasn’t really expecting anything spectacular, just enough to get me from point A to point B. \r\n\r\nBut story isn’t everything, gameplay is very important as well. So how does the game hold up in the gameplay department? Not bad actually, not amazing, but fun enough to keep you going. Combat is the same thing you’ve seen in every other third person action adventure shooter, and there’s nothing wrong with that, that’s actually good. Lara has a standard assortment of weapons with the obligatory survivalist bow, which is fun to upgrade, and a neat little climbing axe she uses for, well, climbing and of course killing. Another addition to combat is her “survival instincts” which helps you pinpoint enemies you can’t see.  While the mechanics are functional there is another aspect of combat, which is very important, difficulty, and this is another thing I’m just mad at. On its hardest setting the game is just way to easy, there is little to no challenge when fighting enemies, the only times when I did manage to get killed were when my whole screen was filled with enemies all rushing to blow my face off. \r\n\r\nTo put it shortly, it didn’t feel as if Lara was in any danger, it felt as if it was an obstacle to pass. But there is great side activity that keeps your mind working, tombs. These fun little brainteasers brake up the monotony, and there is just the right amount of them. The game offers a neat little level up screen and an upgrade bench but that feels a bit rushed, and a bit unbalanced, you will find some upgrades completely useless and some you will just abuse.  \r\n\r\nOkay, so you get how the game feels, but how does it look? Amazing. The game looks amazing. The environments are very diverse and detailed and some scenes were actually breathtaking. The first time you exit a cave and see your ship on the beach of the island was very reminiscent of the moment you leave the vault in Fallout 3, it’s the kind of moment that lingers on and on. \r\n", "likes": 1, "slug": "a-survivor-is-born-and-it-grows-up-to-be-a-bloodthirsty-killing-machine", "introduction": "\"Tomb Raider\" is an action adventure developed by Crystal Dynamics and released in 2013.", "platform": 12, "created_at": 1399806462601, "negative_points": ">Terrible character development\r\n>Way to easy for a game about survival\r\n>Uninteresting and basic story\r\n>Forgettable side characters\r\n>Upgrade system could have been better", "id": 10, "game": 1164, "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/tomb-raider--2/reviews/a-survivor-is-born-and-it-grows-up-to-be-a-bloodthirsty-killing-machine", "rating_category": 2, "username": "Kalipto"}, {"title": "Is this the Spider-man Game we have been waiting for?

Previous Metal Gear Solids had a camera angle that represented movie cinema cameras, gradually panning/zooming or stationary camera shots.  In Ground Zeroes, the camera represents a person's point of view, which made me feel like I was, for example, walking with Skullface across Camp Omega in the opining sequence.\r\n\r\nAnother thing about this game is that it's friendly to newcomers to the stealth genre/game series.  There is a reflex mode which allows the player to quickly kill/tranquilize the individual who saw the player (Big Boss) before alerting the base.  You can switch that off if you wish, for a more realistic experience.  The lighting in this game is simply spectacular.  In one of the interviews with Hideo Kojima (developer/director) he said that the lighting will be enhanced to also encompass a stealth aspect.  He was not lying.  Big Boss is easier to spot in the light, and can crouch behind small rocks to protect himself from big towers, with large searchlights.\r\n\r\nThe gameplay is extremely fluid as well.  Going from crouching, to crawling, to walking is simple and seems realistic as well.  Metal Gear Solid 4 had that same feature, but it is done much better in Ground Zeroes.\r\n\r\nI love the fact there is an opening and ending cutscene, and pure gameplay in between.  One of the biggest complaints gamers had with Metal Gear Solid was the fact that they had to stop playing every now and then to watch a cutscene.  Now, you don't have to worry about that. An added bonus is that all of the cutscenes can be skipped at will.\r\n\r\nThe biggest complaint of the game is the short time.

You pretty much beat the game when you completely pay off your house and in this game you have to make your town the best it can be. \r\n\r\nNow paying off your house in New Leaf is great. In the previous games you get stuck in Tom Nook's terrible debt system where you get rewarded with even more debt. This game, however, allows you to not be in debt. You pay it off as you want. \r\n\r\nFishing and bug catching are pretty much the same. Obviously they have added more bugs and fish. But the controls and stuff are the same. But they work with no complaints. Slingshot gets the balloons down. This I actually preferred in the previous games. Because in older games you shoot down a balloon and get furniture. Now in New Leaf you only get Balloon Furniture which I personally don't like. So I sell it. I preferred the random any furniture. They did add a new thing of diving. Which now you can get a wetsuit and swim in the ocean and dive for underwater creatures that aren't fish. It is a neat thing.\r\n\r\nThe shops are figured out. Nook's Homes sells house remodeling and upgrades to your house. Able Sisters have a third sister that sells hats and facegear. And you can talk to Sable and get QR Codes from the interwebs. Which is really neat. Tom Nook's nephews run the store that sells the basic goods. Same thing though. They upgrade as you buy more stuff from the store. Kicks has a store now that sells shoes and socks. Which makes your character super customizable now. Plus you can buy pants as well. Club LOL is the club you unlock which gets Shrunk and KK Slider. It's fun to just chill in there. The Museum is a museum. You can unlock a second floor and get four new rooms. Dream Suit and Shampoodles. Cool stuff. Also in the town they added the Re-Tail place which is the best. That's where you can sell stuff to and sell furniture to villagers. \r\n\r\nPublic works projects are meh. This is sort of the bigger things that annoy people. For all the cool stuff, a villager has to come up to you and ask for it. Which feels so unlucky. \r\n\r\nSpeed run is not possible. There are two ways to play Animal Crossing. First is letting the game run and wait days and days for things to happen. Or you time travel which can get a bit clunky and confuses the game. But it's a legit stategy. The game is run by year. So at Christmas there is snow and Santa and all that good stuff.

Each of these classes offers a different style of play as well as their own unique skills and abilities. The Barbarian is a standard tank/DPS class, which is the same as any other warrior class. The Wizard is a full on DPS, whom uses a diverse set of ranged spells. The Witch Doctor is another spellcaster whose main strength is the ability to summon minions to fight for them. The Demon Hunter is a ranged DPS that uses crossbows and longbows as well as an assortment of traps for tactical combat. And the final class, the Monk is probably the most interesting class; it’s the only class that can be used to fill any of the standard MMO roles (DPS, Tank, Healer). The Monk uses short ranged spells and melee attacks to fight its enemies as well as passive and active healing abilities to aid their allies, and can also have a decent amount of health points as well as armor points.\r\n\r\nThe game starts off with the falling of a star through a cathedral, which is found near the town of New Tristram. This event sets off a chain reaction that causes all of the nearby dead to rise and attack the innocent inhabitants and, as you might have guessed, it is up to you to save them and investigate the site of the fallen star. Not to spoil anything but it does get a tad more complex then that later on.\r\n\r\nNow, “Diablo’s” story isn’t very complex, it’s actually quite basic when you look at its barebones, but they do cover those bones up very nicely with rich lore and interesting backstories. Most of the boss encounters are built up with great stories of their horrific powers and evil deeds. \r\n\r\nBut the story itself isn’t really something that will leave you wanting more, it’s the gameplay that will make you want more. “Diablo 3” brings a well-crafted combination of fun and challenge to the table. The controls transfer very well to the console versions, even though the interface could have used a little bit more work, but we’ll get to that later on. The combat is fast paced and quite easy to get the hang of for beginners. The addition of the dodge and lock on controls are what make the difference. Dodging becomes a very important part of the combat in some situations, as you really need to maneuver a lot, and lock on really helps the ranged players when they’re trying to pick off targets in large clusters. \r\nThe game features a total of 8 difficulty settings (easy, normal, hard, master 1-5) and 4 campaign modes (Normal, Nightmare, Hell, Inferno) each more sadistic than the last. And if you’re a real masochist you’ll love Hardcore mode, in which you have only ONE life the whole game, so um yeah, good luck with that. The games main strengths come from its spectacular boss fights of which I thought were too little, a total of 10 (can’t remember the exact number) true fights. The first few felt a bit lazy and weren’t very creative, but by the end of Act II they start getting better and better. Beating the main campaign on the 1st mode unlocks the 2nd and so on. So to get the most out of your game you will probably go through around 4-5 times. But you’re probably thinking “Why?”, well that’s exactly what I thought at first and then my first legendary dropped. That moment is something that any “loot whores” like me will love, it’s basically the same effect as beating a dungeon boss in an MMO and getting to see what he dropped. This obviously won’t work on everybody, but it’s very easy to get hooked on the concept, especially if you’re playing with friends. Even though the looting is fun, you still have to level up to use it. Now this is where I thought the game really simplified it too much. There is no choice in leveling, you get all the skills you can use at certain points and variations to those same skills, but there is no talent tree which most players have come to love in the old “Diablo” games.\r\n\r\nWhich brings me to the most important addition of the console versions, offline 4-player local co-op. This was the prime reason I got the game, to play with my friends. Now this might not seem like a big deal, but it is for anyone that enjoys couch co-op and hack & slash RPGs. It offers that feeling of exploration and questing with your friends in an MMO, especially once you get to the bosses. Co-op also offers the ability to quickly devise tactics and create combos. Having your party with you will really speed up the combat and make it easier and fun, and just to keep it challenging, I’d recommend pushing the difficulty up if you’re gonna play with a full team. But that all doesn’t mean that multiplayer is perfect. The camera can be a problem at some rare moments and could get you killed a couple of times and at some larger clusters of enemies the frame rate will drop a bit. But the main issue I had with the game was the inventory management in multiplayer. Dear God, this can really take a while since only 1 inventory screen can be open at a time, and the inventory itself can be a bit of a bother since all of the gear is based on wheel and comparing items does take a while even when you’re alone. \r\n\r\nThe entire game is from a 3D isometric point of view and is filled with a range of different environments, from the dark forests of Tristram to desolate deserts and Heaven itself. However the game doesn’t offer much in the way of enemies. You will mostly be fighting similar undead or demonic enemies throughout the entire game, although the game does have certain enemies that are specific to their regions but the problem is in their skillsets, most of them will have the same strengths and weaknesses, despite the fact some of them are completely different monsters. When you reach Inferno and ramp up the difficulty, the elite enemies will have multiple additional skills, which will make the combat a bit more interesting, but most of the time the difficulty comes from the enemies’ numbers rather than any real increase in power.\r\n\r\n", "likes": 0, "slug": "evil-has-risen-for-a-third-time", "introduction": "\"Diablo 3\" is an action roleplaying hack & slash game developed by Blizzard Entertainment and released for consoles in 2013.", "platform": 12, "created_at": 1402572445548, "negative_points": ">Basic story\r\n>Multiplayer could have used more polish\r\n>Weak leveling system\r\n>2 or 3 more class options wouldn't have hurt", "id": 23, "game": 120, "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/diablo-iii/reviews/evil-has-risen-for-a-third-time", "rating_category": 2, "username": "Kalipto"}, {"title": "The best game ever!", "views": 203, "category": 1, "conclusion": "I enjoyed every moment playing this game.", "updated_at": 1402663140642, "positive_points": "Fun\r\nGreat story\r\nSo many things to do", "content": "The story is amazing.

This game has two modes. Survival and Creative. \r\n\r\n Survival mode is where the game lets you survive through your life living off the land. It's best to play with friends but same things happen either way. You start a world. And everybody starts chopping trees and/or digging mines. Both are important but are still over done. Then everyone forgets to make a farm until they start getting hungry. Then one or two guys will build a farm or find a village. Then night comes around and this first night will really kick the game off. Because if the guy mining didn't find iron to make shears then nobody can get a bed. So you bury yourself underground to hide from creepers and other mobs.  And the game is pretty much like that. Slowly gather materials to build your house. Then have an endless supply of cobblestone and dirt. Then you look at the clock and see that 15 hours have passed. It's time for bed or play through the actual night.\r\n\r\nCreative mode is a lot different. You are given everything.

Monsters, Crime and mystery fit very well in to the dark setting and there is some very original stuff in here. There is romance and sex. There is gore and death not only for monsters. The dialogs all make sense and there are even some really hilarious comments from various characters. So there is funny stuff, but comedy is on a tight leash. For me it was just the right amount.\r\n\r\nThe story does even have some twists that I could not foresee.\r\n\r\nThe story alone is enough to get me hooked on the franchise. There is a lot about the past, and a lot about the now known future (Witcher 3), so the story feels evolving. 10/10\r\n\r\n\r\nGraphics\r\n\r\nThe Witcher 2 has its own engine. It does the job it was made for quite well. Everything already looks very good, even a few years after release. I cant give this top rating though, since it is not at the today's optical standards. \r\nThere are also some problems with the engine. I did encounter some strange optic glitches in texures, that however did not really bother me. Here and there are some not important objects, mostly for looting, that I just could not use (loot), and the disablility to jump is just feeling weird. Nothing stopped the flow of the game though.\r\nKeeping in mind that the company still didn't have that much experience at the time I see these as quirks of a still new engine and have the highest hopes, that the new installment for witcher3 will not only look (extremly) good, but will also miss these.\r\nFor settings the only thing I missed was borderless window mode. Everything essential was there.\r\n\r\nNow the level design, the scenes and most of all the atmosphere was incredibly good. Everything just feels right, there is so much detail in the design of the environment and the clothing. Even the swords on your back a held properly and do not just magically float on your back. Also the npcs get on with their lives and do stuff depending on the time and situation. It just feels alive. 8/10\r\n\r\n\r\nAudio\r\n\r\nVery nice and fitting music. Slider for music, dialogs and game sounds, which is all you need, but you will need to adjust them correctly. Standard settings pretty much made me not hear the important dialogs. If you get it right the atmosphere auf the audio is as good as the optical one, enabling you to loose yourself in the game completely. The only time it fails, is when a lot of npc's stand together and talk all at once. Especially in the prologue this was annoying, but wasn't noticeable often later in the game.\r\nThe soundeffects were not annoying at all, which in modern games is not really a matter of course apparently. The voiceacting, which is for every npc and the player character, was really really good, too. I enjoyed listing to some of them quite a bit. It was not perfect all the time, but still really good for a game. 9/10\r\n\r\n\r\nControls\r\n\r\nThe controls were the hardest to come around to. It took me more than half an hour to get used to the controls and the fight-mechanics, but after that everything was well. There are not many keys you actually need and you just don't have to think about which button to press after some time. You just do. I do not think that it matters much, if you play on keyboard or with the controller. I decided to go with the keyboard, because I'm just more used to it.\r\nThe settings for controlers had everything I think someone could need. I did not have to change anything. So even with the long accommodation phase... 10/10\r\n\r\n\r\nFun\r\n\r\nI had a very good time with this game. Lots of fun. It was epic, emotional from time to time and quite challenging. The quests were intersting and had just enough diversity. Some fights are a little bit frustrating and you have to find the right tactic to do it, but it's more rewarding to beat something, if you lost to it a few times before, right? One or two times it ended in boring hit&run, but since that happend very rarely its fine.\r\nIn theory this game even has a high replayability. There are a lot of different game endings, two destinct decisions that will change the course of the game quite a lot, and even some dialog options alone tempt to just reload and try the other one.\r\nIt's still a roleplaying game, though. For me that means... once the story is done, it is done. This is the way it happend, everything else is wrong! It is fun to talk to friends how the story differs from their experience though! The good thing is: you can go on with your savegame in witcher3! So the story as it happend to you will go on exactly as it was for you. This is the same with witcher1 and 2. If you played witcher1 (recommended) you will notice it in witcher2! 9/10", "likes": 1, "slug": "the-witcher-2-assassins-of-kings-enhanced-edition", "introduction": "This is a fantastic game and will probably stay in my top5 for a long time.

I've been playing football (soccer) games since 1998 and can confidently say this is the worst football game i've ever played. The gameplay is laggy and broken. Glitches are everywhere. matches are far too slow, players far too clumsy and to put it bluntly the game is no longer enjoyable. After finding a near-perfect formula in fifa 13, EA attempted to modify the gameplay heavily and in doing so have completely ruined it. \r\n\r\nOutside of the matches themselves, the career mode changes have slowed down manager mode to the point where it's now a chore rather than fun. It's tried to take a step towards football manager and has now ended up in a poor middle ground that doesn't cater to anyone. I enjoy football manager games and the depth they provide, i also enjoy fifa games and the simplicity they bring. I wanted more involvement as a manager, but the new transfer system is far too awkward and tedious to use. The old scouting system provided enough depth while not being too much of a hindrance or slowing things down too much. The new career mode attempts to be a sim but doesn't pay enough attention to the important details to be one. There is still too much erratic behavior issues (injured players complaining that you aren't playing them) and broken areas such as player growth that fifa still can't seem to get right.\r\n\r\nUltimate team has seem some additions, but they're still missing the collection book, which is an omission that is far too frustrating for a collection based game mode.

They did have some good and neat stuff. Like The Prodigy and Axel F. But then they used so much Lil' Wayne and Kanye West. Which if you're like me. I don't enjoy them at all. And it was so much of it. And the songs that I didn't know on DJ Hero 2 were not making me feel any better. DJ Hero was more classic hip hop. DJ Hero 2 was more R&B and modern rap.

In the 10 missions there are different challenges, from protecting some oil pipes, to a last stand mode. With each kill you make, you get tons of blood, all this blood is counted in buckets, for every bucket you get around 1 dollar and a (very) little bit of XP. You also get a reward in accordance with the difficulty level you play on. With this money you can buy weapons, clothing and accessories (after unlocking them depending on your level).

The game itself is a little bit glitchy, but not that you feel it. It's a shame that there isn't a multiplayer, but for that, you gotta play the next game in this serie: FoL: Multi Massacre.

During the intro sequence you escape Vaas’s encampment and meet up with the Rakyat, the natives of Rook Island. They tell you that you are the chosen warrior that will defeat Vaas and bring glory to the Rakyat. And basically after you complete a couple of tutorial quests, you can go on and explore the island (to a certain point until you have to progress the main plot).  \r\n\r\nSo what do people do for fun around here? \r\nWell quite a lot of things can be done here. The two main side objectives would be the outposts, which need liberation and radio towers, which need activation. After doing one of those two things more side quests will open up and complete enough of these and you will get recreational activities such as: knife throwing, target practice, poker and island racing. Which are nice ways to make a few bucks or just have fun. In addition to these activities you also have Trials of the Rakyat, a total of 12 challenges in which you must use a certain weapon to kill as many enemies as possible before the timer runs out. This is the competitive leaderboard portion of the main campaign.  \r\n\r\nWhy have one island, when you can have two? \r\nThe game is split into two large islands, which are both beautiful and detailed to make for a great exploration experience. The northern island populated by the Rakyat and Vaas’s pirates and the second controlled by the troops of Hoyt Wolker. Visually it’s more of the same and gameplay wise the only difference between them is that the enemies on the southern island are a bit tougher. In a nutshell, the first/northern island is where you gear up and the second/southern island is where you put that gear to good use. Even though this isn’t bad, most of the elements from the first island will be forgotten on the second one for most players. By the time you reach island number 2, you will have gathered most of the equipment you will need and will have crafted all of the holsters and bags. \r\n\r\nHave I ever told you the definition of insanity? \r\nIt's doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results, a pretty simple definition, but it’s also how I would define the gameplay in “Far Cry 3”. Now, this doesn’t mean the game is repetitive, far from it, it means that it offers new ways of approaching old objectives. The best example would be the outposts which you have to liberate, of which there are a total of 34. Basically you have to reach the outpost and kill all the guards, and that does sound repetitive, but “Far Cry 3” offers you multiple ways to do that. You can stealthily take out all of the guards before the alarm is sounded, charge them head on, lure wild animals to attack the guards, or just burn that motherfucker to the ground while listening to “Make it Bun Dem”, and many more ways you’ll have to find out for yourself, either way you’re going to have a lot of fun doing it.  \r\n\r\nOnce you clear an outpost you will not only be rewarded with experience points and money, but with new missions, three types to be exact. WANTED: Dead, a straightforward, find the target, eliminate the target, but you must always use a knife when doing so, such is the tradition of the Rakyat. Path of the Hunter, hunting mission in which you hunt various animals with a predetermined weapon. And finally Story quests, these are short little missions, which are given to you by certain NPCs and are always something different. \r\nAnother element that offers a great deal of variation is the modes of transportation. On Rook Island you have the option of using cars, trucks, boats, jet skis, hang gliders or the awesome wingsuit to travel around the island.\r\n\r\nFull synchronization. \r\nWhile there is an uncanny resemblance to “Assassin’s Creed” in the way that you can climb atop tall radio towers to activate them to reveal a portion of the map during which you get a little cutscene showing off some of the landmarks in the area. There is also one element in which “Far Cry 3” reminds me of “Assassin’s Creed” and that’s in the stealth elements. Now, while there aren’t haystacks in which you can hide or conceal bodies, stealth plays a major role in the game and is encouraged more often then one would think. Which can be seen by the increased amount of experience points you get when completing a mission stealthily, as oppose to completing it loudly. This is something that could have been rushed or poorly executed quite easily, but it wasn’t. Stealth has a certain depth and variety to it. You can use silenced weapons, the bow, or just takedown enemies up close, and over time when you get newer abilities you will be able to adapt your strategies and make them better and more efficient. Use the foliage as cover and sneak by enemies, cause distractions by making loud noises at certain points, disable their alarms so they can’t call for backup. \r\n\r\nNow the question is, are you motivated enough to do all this? \r\nYes. The game does a good job at motivating you with its fine story and interesting characters. While the main plot is straight forward; save your captive friends and get off the island, the depth comes from its cast and character development. Vaas is easily one of the best villains I have had the pleasure of facing in any game, although he was underused, having more of him wouldn’t have hurt the game, and it would have actually made it better. Jason, our main protagonist, is just an average rich boy looking to have fun with his friends, but Rook Island changes him in ways he would have never imagined. Driven by the psychotic mind games of Vaas, the manipulation of the Rakyat, the pure adrenaline that comes from all of the near death experiences, and the difficult choices he must make to save his friends. Citra, the “leader” of the Rakyat, promises you power with which you can fight Vaas, but it all comes at a price, which will ultimately decide your fate. Hoyt Wolker, Vaas’s boss, feels a bit underwhelming, rushed and not developed very well when compared to Vaas, one of the less memorable characters “Far Cry 3” has to offer. Now without going into detail/spoilers about the ending I’ll just describe how it turns out, essentially it’s just press LT for this ending or RT for that ending, this is the only time you get a choice like this in the game, and feels very out of place and just slapped on to make players feel like they have a choice in the matter, which really wasn’t needed at all. Unfortunately, whichever ending, I found them both a bit unsatisfying in comparison to the whole game.\r\n\r\nYou don’t have to go it alone. \r\n“Far Cry 3” offers multiplayer along with it’s great singleplayer experience. The multiplayer aspect consists of competitive and cooperative modes. I didn’t play the competitive mode so I’ll only be talking about the cooperative portion. The co-op mode is comprised of six missions in total and can played with 2-4 players (2 – player local split screen and 4 – player online/system link), and this really came as a surprise to me. I didn’t think the game needed co-op, but that was before I had a chance to try it out. Across the six missions I found that the same variety that was available in the singleplayer campaign made an appearance here as well. The missions have different objectives, which you have to complete, but also have a small competition section that is different in every mission. This really came out of nowhere and added a fun way to complete an objective whilst competing with your friends.

I would assume the majority of players first played Minecraft to some extent and figured they'd try what appeared to be a sidescrolling version of that game.\r\n\r\nWhile everything seems straight forward for the first hour or so, it wasn't long before i realised just how much depth there is with this game. There's a lot to it, much more than i had anticipated. Worlds within worlds, lots of different environments, enemies, weapon types, spells, armor and items to keep you entertained and occupied. I usually don't like to compare games when reviewing them but i think many will draw a comparison to this and Minecraft, and personally i find this to be much more combat and adventure focused rather than the sandbox/building focus that lies with the latter. For me personally, that's a good thing. There are a dozen or so bosses and they all pose different challenges and can be fought in different ways. The world itself feels very alive and as so much of the game is random different playthroughs on different worlds can provide many hours of entertainment.\r\n\r\nThere aren't too many major flaws with the game itself. Controls can be a bit awkward (on PS3 at least) and there is the occasional bit of slowdown and lag, but nothing too severe. My only real problem with Terraria is the negative aspect of the huge amount of depth within the game. I find myself having to use the wiki or a guide most of the time i play, as every hour or so you find yourself with a bag full of items that can be pretty confusing as you're never really sure what to do with it all. You have to build houses for NPCs and storage space for the many items that you'll need on your travels. Bosses normally require summoning along with an 'arena' of some kind and specific items/equipment to get through, all of which takes time and can be incredibly awkward. The challenge of each boss is good, but the sheer amount of preparation beforehand detracts from the experience somewhat. I find myself spending a lot of time micro-managing items and manipulating the land itself just so i can do x y and z before finally doing what i originally set out to do.

There are some traditional rpg elements (such as character improvement and equipment) but it's all very straightfoward and doesn't get in the way of the fun stuff. The game is designed in a way that you can't just charge into an area sword first, hoping for the best.

A gameplay gripe i have is that there is no way to look outside of your current screen, which in a very difficult platformer is a bit of an issue. There are rooms where you have to fall a large distance and you have no way of knowing where enemies/spikes will be on the ground so it becomes a guessing game.

That's a great thing. The map is bigger than we've ever seen in a GTA game before, and the story (when you add in the side missions) goes on for a damn long time. Added to this, the game has a huge online component, featuring lots of missions, activities and character customization. You can also make and download yours/other peoples missions which provides a bit more diversity when playing. There are lots of minor additions to the game that make things less awkward and are nice touches. Weapon/radio wheels rather than having to manually cycle through each 10 times. A quick save action rather than having to go all the way back to your safe house. Online properties. Special single player abilities depending on who you're playing as. These are all nice features and add to the game. On top of that you have the most realistic grand theft auto game to date. Unfortunately, that's where the problems begin to appear.\r\n\r\nFor me, the realism in GTA V comes at a price, and sadly that price is fun. There are many examples of how i feel it adversely affects the game, but i'll just list a few to keep this review from becoming ridiculously long. Firstly, character switching in offline. It would be a great feature, if it was implemented properly. The problem is that most times when you switch character the new character you switch to is miles across the other side of the map or in a bad situation. (in some cases getting chased by police which is just frustrating)  It's fun and interesting the first couple of times, but as you progress through the story it begins to get incredibly tedious switching and having to sort out your character for 10 minutes before being able to do your originally planned task. Similarly, the game changes your characters out of their clothes. What's the point in letting us buy loads of clothes and accessories if i leave the character for 5 minutes and they've changed by the time i switch back? Relating to realism, it's far too easy to die in GTA V. I don't want to be invincible, but you can die stupidly quickly in way too many circumstances. You fall down the smallest gap, land on your head - you die. Land a big jump on a bike, leaning slightly back or forward - you die. Car flips - you die. A.I. can mow you down in bullets in as little as 2 seconds, from a damn long way away. It just takes the fun out of it. I'm happy to have difficulty in a game, but it's difficulty caused by too much realism. I don't care if i couldn't make that motorbike jump in real life, i want to jump off a mountain and land in a video game without randomly breaking my spine. Missions suffer from this a lot too. I failed a mission because i 'left my buddies behind'. wtf!? If i'm not allowed to leave an area, either tell me first or just invisible barrier me in, or at least give me a warning prompt when i get too far away from my allies. I could go on and on with this subject. Another glaring example was calling a support helicopter, it glitched out and flew away before i got to use it, then when i called they said if i'm not going to use their services properly i'll have to wait, so i had to restart the mission. Needless.\r\n\r\nThe next issue is the police in this game. The police system is completely broken. I have no idea why they've messed about with it so much but i never had these many problems in any past GTA. Your wanted level takes ages to go away, police spawn directly in front of you, they see you through walls or round corners, they know where you are even when they're not supposed to (classed as hidden but they decide to all park directly outside of the alley nobody saw you enter) On top of all this when they do see you they're like love-children of rambo and the terminator. The police in this game are better shots and more difficult to deal with than any other enemy. The men on the ground are bad enough but when they bring out the helicopters... it's just no fun. \r\n\r\nTo keep this review from going on for pages, i'll list the other negatives without providing too much extra info.\r\n\r\nLoading times - waiting for the game/online to load is painful.\r\nThree characters dilutes story - I never felt attached to anyone and didn't care about the antagonists at all. The characters are interesting but you only get to see them for 5 minutes before you jump over to another storyline again.\r\nWeak soundtrack + no custom radio option - Soundtrack doesn't stand up to San Andreas or Vice City, by now we really should have custom radio on consoles.\r\nPoor online matchmaking - The online is really fun.. when you can find other players. 16 player races would often end up being 1 vs 1 because the matchmaking system just doesn't work.\r\nCan't own multiple properties online - why!?\r\nToo many boring missions - 'drive 5 miles to here, to pick up this, to then go here, to then do this...' So many missions felt like chores. \r\nHeists missing from online, single player heists feel too rigid - Single player heists aren't much more than regular missions, and online heists still don't exist. Unacceptable.\r\nA.I. aiming - Mentioned with the police but it applies to all really. Gangsters with smgs should not be tearing me apart when i can only just see them through a sniper rifle scope.\r\nClunky controls - I don't know how this still hasn't been sorted. The game handles awfully on foot. The character runs around in circles of falls off platforms because they're just so damn clunky.\r\nUnbalanced online - if you're going to let high level players have tanks and rpgs, please don't put level 10s with pistols in the same lobby.\r\nVery poor rewards for online challenges - Playing a 20 minute mission solo on hard, killing 30+ enemies and then getting a 10th of a level up sucks.\r\nConsant patches restricting the game - This infuriates me. I get patching out exploits and hacks, that's great. However, patching to reduce rewards from certain missions or to remove strictly fun glitches drives me crazy. The online is supposed to be fun and chaotic!\r\n\r\nI'll be honest, i didn't enjoy this game anywhere near as much as i hoped i would. I've enjoyed every game in the series previous to this but the whole thing just felt like effort. I can't argue with the length of the game, but even the content isn't great. I feel that the game tries to pack in all these modes and activities, some of which shouldn't be an activity in their own right (online parachuting? really?) while others are done much better by other games. I'd rather play a third person shooter, or a racing game, or a tennis game, or a golf game, than each individual aspect in GTA V. That to me i guess is the main problem with the game. It has a lot of stuff to do, but all of it has already been done better by someone else. The graphics and voice acting are very nice, but that alone doesn't make a game.

The gameplay itself isn't as good, with team-mate A.I. being especially painful.

I loved the games prior to the vs. series (most notably here comes the pain) and i'm not sure if it coincides with the programming's decline but i've felt that the games has fallen short for a number of years now and fail to give the experience they should.\r\n\r\nA big feature of SvR 2011 is the universe mode. As a simulation, it works pretty well. Coupled with the fact you can create and download loads of wrestlers to help extend the starting roster it makes for a decent game mode. Unfortunately it lacks stat tracking (which in a simulation style mode is unforgivable) and feels quite rigid in terms of the matches that are scheduled and the rankings for belts. The mode desperately needs an option to protect tag teams as i found myself downloading numerous wrestlers and creating the great tag teams from the past only for them to disband two weeks later and start feuding with each other. In the space of two months of simming i had a packed tag team division with 10+ teams deteriorate into a 3 way fight for the title.  It really stopped me from enjoying the mode as the second i stepped away and let the game take any kind of control it ended up destroying everything i had built. Simply providing an option to stop the game from disbanding teams without the players say so would prevent this and make the mode much more enjoyable.\r\n\r\nOutside of the simming within wwe universe the game really does fall apart. The gameplay in matches is very sluggish and boring. Control feels clunky and each move is telegraphed. Everything feels like a chore and a far cry from the incredibly fun gameplay of 'Here Comes The Pain' or 'Shut Your Mouth'. Along with this the commentary is awful and might has well of been excluded. Commentators blurt out random lines that often make no sense in relation to what is happening in the ring. It completely breaks any immersion the player may have in a match.\r\n\r\nAlong with the universe mode mentioned above, the other main mode in SvR 2011 is the road to wrestlemania mode. It functions as a story mode but is incredibly restrictive and linear, much more so than the story modes from previous years. I much preferred when the concepts of universe mode and road to wrestlemania mode were fused into a single story mode. In which you could make decisions and work towards wrestlemania, but also have other fixtures and events going on around you.

The game is nice and relaxing with relaxing music and sounds of the ocean. I enjoy finding and learning about all the fish and other creatures.

Then the next two times you have to come back at different times and interact some more. Weird but not bad. \r\n\r\nThere is a story. I haven't finished the game but I can see the idea of it all. You and Katherine Sunday go on a mission to fill out your encyclopedia with demands from the bossman. Also while out sailing around you get requests from random people to see fish. These guys will roll up in a jet ski and want to see one specific fish. Which is easy enough until they start to whine and complain that we cannot find the fish they want. \"Hey look a whale and a shark and an octopus. But I'm not satisfied until I see a Oriental Butterflyfish.\" And Katherine Sunday is backwards. She is a marine biologist that cannot swim. And she holds you back from exploring the cool stuff like trenches and caves. Which are just unlockables. And also while on the boat there will be random animals that spawn on the boat. From penguins to a polar bear. How they get on the boat, I don't know. Not bad. Just odd. There are treasures you can find and dolphins you can train. A custom aquarium is there. That is pretty cool. \r\n\r\nThe biggest issue is that some fish that I have interacted with do not give me the info about them. This really bothers me. It's like seeing a rare wild Pokémon and you cannot catch it because you have no Pokeballs. Only difference is this is the games fault. \r\n\r\nThe controls can be a bit clunky at times too.

Since then the franchise has gotten progressively worse in a very uniform pattern I have coined: 'The nostalgia vortex'. The phenomenon occurs when you have such a brain fryingly good time with a game as a child that you would wait untill mum goes to bed before turning it on again with the volume at 1% so you could still hear the jingly noises that made up so much of the fun. Then, as the years go by and you develop curious hair and an interest in the opposite sex that you forget about the game for a while. Eventually after being rejected by the opposite sex and the hair thing has also lost it's novelty, you blow the dust out of those old cartridges and see if the old girl still works. Amazing! It does!

It was made in a couple of weeks so don’t expect a game in the size and scope of GTA with goats. In fact, you’re better off not expecting anything at all actually. To be completely honest, it would be best if you’d spend your $10 on a hula hoop, a pile of bricks, or maybe a real-life goat.\"\r\n\r\nThere are several reasons for that.

It had limited troop movement, turn based engagement, and civilization-building themes. Yet, it was not as complicated as Civilizations-and I think this is one of the things that made it great. There were many different things that you could do in the game, and you could choose whether or not you wanted to. Many of the things, such as settlement development and diplomacy could be set on automatic. Surprisingly, the ai was excellent for this, and I often indulged in this to focus on things that interested me more. The turn-based system worked perfectly for the game, since it reflected well the time period that it was portraying. I thought it was particularly brilliant how one could play as the natives. As is accurate for the time-it was extremely difficult to win with the natives. However, it was possible-essentially, the natives could only be levelled up to 2 (as opposed to 4). However, they could expand and build troops waaay faster than the other nations. This meant that, if you were quick, you could destroy the other nations before they gained a foothold on the land. \r\nBeyond the above gameplay, the turn-based system worked so effectively because it allowed you to micromanage to your heart's delight. I remember my brothers and I would play this game, and quite often one person would take 1/2 hour or more on a turn. The other two players would be off doing completely different things-so games could last for quite a while. Conveniently-you did not have to finish a game in one sitting, and could save a game for a later date.

Pieces of the story keep unfolding throughout the game and mostly the conversations are nice to listen to. The story has a twist where you can chose which side you want to join and you can change every bit of conversation between Geralt and other characters with the phrases you're presented with. The only downside would be that Geralt doesn't always say the thing that you chose , but he changes the response a little.\r\nYou are also presented with 2 endings so if you really like the game you can play it twice without worries cause you have some more content if you play again and chose a different path. \r\n\r\nControls \r\n\r\nThe controls are pretty good once you accommodate with them.

They might tend to look repetitive after a while. ( I played the game 3 times from the beginning to the end)\r\n\r\nAudio \r\n\r\nThe audio in this game is pretty relaxing.

But witcher 3 ain't too far either. The surrounding graphics are really good , the only thing that's not so good is the grass which you can fix with a mod that you can get for free. The lights are bright and colorful which makes the game stunning. There are some graphical glitches from place to place but they aren't that annoying (one being an invisible pair of boots , your boots wont display neither your feet , but that's with only one certain pair of boots you get on insane mode). \r\nAlso in case you're disappointed with the graphics in the end , don't worry , Witcher 3 is arriving and you'll get even better graphics and an open world.\r\n\r\n", "likes": 0, "slug": "witcher-2-assassins-of-kings-review-by-leinchetzu", "introduction": "Hello , my name is Nick and i'm here to introduce you to the world of The Witcher.

The controls mean that silly glitches happen quite frequently, which means that you are suddenly needing to completely restart your mission. At one point in the game, you are told to kill 9 lieutenants in order to help start an uprising. Five I could understand-even six, but nine?! And each one has a frustrating way to get at the person-although all are essentially the same. At this point in the game, the story has dragged on so long that you (or at least I) was desperate to finally get to the ending, and I found standing in my way an incredibly tedious line of trial-and error. Luck should not be a significant factor in a game such as this, yet it truly is. This game is ridiculously long-needlessly long.  The storyline needed to be much more succinct, and the intentional extension of gameplay only served to cause a great deal of frustration.

And the environment is executed in a way to where you really do almost feel isolated, except, the level design sucks. If I had to give this game a score, I’d give it a 5 for trying.", "updated_at": 1428756963057, "positive_points": "Environment\r\nHacking systems\r\nSoundtrack", "content": "Boast: The Creative Assembly (Total War, Stormrise), wanted to create an adapting and learning Alien, one with an advanced AI so that you couldn’t use the same tactic on it twice and would hunt you down by smell, sound, and sight. And it would be totally awesome… if the AI was good. I’m gonna hit you with something real quick. You die a lot in this game, and the save points aren’t too forgiving, which I think is what the devs were going for. But, when you reload, you have to go through some unecessary shit to actually get to the ‘gameplay’ section of where you last died. And the enemies (androids, other humans and the Alien), can find you anywhere. There was no point in hiding, holding your breath, leaning away, or being all the way across the room shrouded in smoke. All of that meant nothing. You could argue either way that it  helped the game, or hurt it. In all actuality though, it was a broken mechanic. It got to the point where it was frustrating, and when you passed the alien, it wasn’t satisfying.\r\n\r\n\r\nEyeCandy: I launched the game and it was running pretty choppy. Not the cinematics, those looked great. They looked really good. It’s probably one of the highest praises I’d give the game, especially the lighting and the particles. I’m talking about when I was able to first walk around. I said, “What the?”, went to the video menu, and EVERY setting was jacked up to Ultra. I don’t have a bad rig, but holy hell, that was ridiculous. So then I put everything as low as it could go, or off, (out of spite), and it looked very damn well close to the max settings. Though, I should mention that the game still ran slow and laggy. Strike one. Regardless though, it looked surprisingly well. The artwork and texturing are great and it covers up the mediocrity in the modeling. But that just comes from them having a budget. The way every environment was illustrated really did set the tone and the mood for the game. It was all run-down, everything was broken, the environment was uncomfortable and I think that’s what the developers were trying to do. I loved it. Also, it all looked retro and 70’s-ish so that was kind of badass. The characters are pretty skimped out on though, except the Alien. All of the polys and budget went straight to the Alien. It looks phenomenal. Other than that, Isolation looks like a half-upgrade from a Valve game.\r\n\r\nSound: There’s multiple settings in the game for your preferred audio experience. The two I played with were Full Dynamic Range and simply, Headphones. So, tell me why there was a nil difference between the two. The sound design and spacial recognition were absolutely atrocious. The redundancy of sounds will confuse you into thinking there’s a usable machine to your left, but it’s not. It’s actually upstairs, two rooms away, and it’s a completely different object. The dialogue, to change subjects, is not written well. I was going through a vent and my partner asked a personal question. Cool, character divulsion and story expansion. But that was it. He just asked me a question and Ripley didn’t answer, so we kept on crawling. But maybe that was a good thing, because the main character (oh God the main character), is so bad at voice acting it’s not even funny. Worse than Kristen Stewart. Enough said. It doesn’t make any sense though, because the supporting cast does a good, industry standard, job. It was very disappointing to experience something like that. There’s nothing to say about the soundtrack, it’s all ambiance. Except, I will say that the use of buildup was pretty cool. You hear the dissonant strings rise in volume and a rapid drum that simulates a fast heartbeat, it was pretty cool. Sound wise though, that’s the only thing that stood out.\r\n\r\nGameplay: This one might be a doozy. First off, this game has the slowest beginning in the history of slow beginnings I have ever played. Part of the problem is that the game has no sense of direction. A good game directs you without letting you know you’re being directed. This one makes it obvious (the use of certain lights), but then all of a sudden stops and you have to backtrack to where you were and go somewhere you didn’t know you could access because of bad design and a bad explanation of features that are in the game. I don’t expect a game to hold my hand, but at least tell me basic mapping controls. It doesn’t tell you there’s a run button until maybe an hour in, so all the backtracking and ‘exploring’ I’m doing is all walking and the running doesn’t move you any faster. I’m talking Slenderman speed here, slow as hell.\r\n\r\nAlso, the game has bad programming. I went into a room, activated a generator, and then nothing happened (even though that was my objective). So, I went out back into the bigger room and spent a good 12 minutes WALKING around, looking like a dumbass because I’m going up to walls and broken wires crouching (which I also had to figure out), and perusing them but had no luck. I went back into the smaller room to a computer terminal (that I’ve already accessed before), go through all the messages again, and exited out because there was nothing new. And then the power came back on! So I guess I was supposed to read the computer first and then turn on the generator? Bugs happen, I get it. So then a little later I’m at this sneaking part, and I die. I say eff the pre-mission dialogue, do my objective, and go back to the guy. He then continues the pre-mission dialogue and it glitched so I had to reload my save. Bugs happen, I get it. After that episode, we crawl into a vent and my character snapped onto my leader’s back and my character was lodged inside the top of the vent and I had to reload again. Okay, strike two. We came to another sneak section and I literally turned around and bumped into the enemy. I backed up, the music started going, but then nothing happened so we went ahead. My partner caught up, and then HE said, “Follow me!” and did not go anywhere. Let me repeat that, HE DID NOT MOVE. I walked around him, his eyes fixed on me, and then I went ahead and he was following me! What!? I don’t know where to go! There was no indicator telling me where to go. Strike three, I’m done.\r\nTL;DR: The gameplay sucks.", "likes": 0, "slug": "alien-isolation-written-review", "introduction": "Finally, a survival-horror Alien game. That’s how it should be.

More guns, more wacky characters, more Borderlands. Hell of a lot of loot, and a hell of a lot of fun!\r\n\r\nNarrative: Borderlands comes from a story telling perspective. Athena, who has been captured, is explaining to a group of misfits why you were vault hunting. And that’s as much as I’ll go into the story. While there’s nothing really ‘big’ that happens in Borderlands, where they excel is the execution in their comedy. You meet all sorts of quirky people  along the way and Dameon Clarke (Handsome Jack), once again, delivers some of the most hilarious dialogue in any video game. I  actually found him to be the highlight of the game because, in this character, I believe he’s up there with Michael Mondo (Vaas Montenegro).\r\n\r\nEyecandy: The visuals look exactly like Borderlands 2. Which isn’t a bad thing, but isn’t a good thing either. It didn’t even seem like there was any upgrade to the textures, or the engine, and the only change in artwork came from the characters you would eventually run into in Borderlands 2. The HeadsUpDisplay is a copy/paste and there was nothing impressive about the particle effects. I’m a little disappointed that at least here they didn’t apply their professional skill or creativity to make this installment at least visually stand out from the other two. But it’s whatever I guess…\r\n\r\nSoundDesign: The sound engineering was done very nicely. There’s no preset mixes in the options menu, so, if you’re using headphones or running through a home theatre system, you’re out of luck there. All you have to work with is your basic mix of voice, SFX, etc. Never did the sound of action ever become over bearing though. Nor did the background ambiance become a ‘blah’ when there was a lot going on. The music is pretty much all digital-techno-eighties kind of synths for mostly everything. It was produced very nicely and it cut through very smartly from all of the sound filler that was going on. As far as the soundtrack itself, I didn’t like it. I’m not big on the eighties synthesizer sound and it kind of annoyed me. To somewhat give it a perspective, if you liked Blood Dragon’s soundtrack, you’ll like this one.\r\n\r\nGameplay: Now, obviously, you got your four characters to choose from. Skip down to the next paragraph if you don’t care about the characters\r\n-There’s Athena, The Gladiator, whose Kinetic Aspis is a shield that can absorb incoming damage and be thrown to inflict damage (cough…CaptainAmerica, cough). Her skills primarily revolve around defense, healing, and melee.\r\n-Next is Wilhelm, The Enforcer. He’s a cyborg that summons two flying robots named Wolf and Saint that will attack enemies, and defend you at the same time.\r\n-After that is Nisha, The Lawbringer. Her special skill is called “Showdown.” It makes you act like a Call of Duty aim bot and you’ll automatically snap to the heads of your foes getting critical hits out the ass.\r\n-And last there’s Claptrap, The Fragtrap. His ability runs a program called “VaultHunter.exe” which will give him different abilities “that asseses your current situation” and gives you the best ability. Basically it’s a random mix of skills from the other games, i.e. Gunzerker and Mechromancer.\r\n\r\nThe formula is still the same here. If it moves, you shoot it, and you collect loot along the way. I ended up going with Nisha. She seemed like the closest pick to Salvador, because in all honesty there is not much strategy to this game. At its core it’s an FPS. Each class has their customizations, and there’s a little uniqueness from SOME of the skills; but, they always just end up being increased gun damage, reload speed, etc., until you become invincible using your special skill. The guns are the same from Borderlands 2. There’s only one new addition, which is laser. And that’s self explanatory. The biggest twist is the need for O2 or “Oz” because you’re fighting on the moon’s surface. So as you’re traveling and fighting outdoors, enemies will drop canisters and the surface has these air crater pocket-thingies so you can refill and not suffocate. It’s an added feature to the game but it never becomes a problem because you’ll collect it automatically from the enemies you kill and there’s always somewhere indoors to run into close by.

Animations are smooth and the camera feels well and 'natural'. It never went out of whack for me. It's mainly based in a poor slum area and I believe Techland nailed it in the head (pun intended) with the environment. The rundown city has everything. Sewers, highways, caves, tall buildings, fishing ports, everything. They did a damned good job. Not to even mention the texturing and the gore. When you smash a zombies head you see pieces of its skull scattered and brain matter gushing. You can cut off arms and legs and even break their bones to stun them. When you shoot them, you see the hug gaping hole and all of their insides, it is phenomenal. AND all of the infected look disgusting (which is a good thing) and all of the people are diverse which makes the whole thing believable. If something like this were to happen, this is how it would look. Nothing is out of place. You will catch a bug or two, but they're not frequent and they're laughable. Overall, it looks damned good.\r\n\r\nSoundDesign: I would have to say what stood out to me the most was the main character's voice. Roger Craig Smith is mostly known (if you didn't know) for being Ezio in Assassin's Creed. He sounds good, and gave the best emotional performance out of the rest of the cast. There's few times where Dying Light actually has music. It's mostly your basic ambience with screams and other random noises. It sounded good until I figured out it's actually part of the soundtrack and the sound wasn't based on my location but it was just a repeating track pretty much. All of the thuds and cracks and booms sound good. You can hear the feeling of your character vaulting and falling and punching. So in that aspect it was fine. But other than that, there's not much else.\r\n\r\nGameplay: Dying light plays like a Mirrors Edge (Which I f*****g loved!) x Dead Island. It's all about the free running, parkour, and collecting loot by day, so you can survive the night because  night is when the special infected come out of hiding, the zombies are stronger, and all of your points double. It. Is. HARD. There have been plenty of times where I had to run to the nearest safe house and sleep the night away. It ain't no joke. But at least the free-running mechanic is simple. There is a tiny learning curve to it, but once you get it, it's butter. So basically it's easy to do, but challenging to master. And since this game is a zombie game it tends to favor melee weapons. There's all sorts of them too. Everything from pipes and hammers, to swords and concrete chunks on metal rebar. The variety of weapons are fantastic. But then it goes even deeper with the customization of not only the weapons with their crafting, upgrade, and blueprint system and durability/strength stats, but with also your main character. As you fight, kill, and scavenge all game long you earn points to level up. Within their upgrade system you can learn new moves, gain more health, become more efficient at parkour, it's all there, and it's pretty fair to. When you play online you can easily tell apart the low levels from the high levels. Speaking of which...\r\n\r\nOnline Gameplay: Dying Light has a competitive multiplayer, and as well as a cooperative mode. And it's all seamless. If you join someone elses game you keep all of your loot and experience points and can continue where you left off in your own game and vice versa to other players that join you. The game will also tell you if you're ahead in the main story or behind when you join another game, kinda cool. I didn't want to write this game until I played a full four player coop and versus. And it was fun. I got all my buddies in and we're running around, jumping, rolling, fighting off hordes, competing in loot and race events, you name it. This is easily where this game shines. And when night came the special infected jumped in (another player) and we had to destroy these nests while they had to protect them. If you don't work as a team you will lose.

I don't regret my buy if that means anything to you.\r\n\r\nReason: Obviously we all expect this game to either live up to its predecessor or reach beyond it and I honestly feel like Ubisoft didn't achieve that in any way.

To sum it up, this game is more of a transition than an evolution. But don't let that deter you, it's not a bad game, it really isn't.

A place of danger, mythology, and mystery. A place that's never boring and every second is a story.\r\n\r\nNarrative: The story takes place in Kyrat, a fictitious country in the Himalayans. You play as Ajay (Ah-jay), who is coming back to this country to spread his mothers ashes upon her birthplace but while there you get thrown into a civil war between the Natives, and a dictator named Pagan Min (Troy Baker) who, for an unknown reason, has an odd attraction toward you. The story's pacing is very quick. Playing it, you can tell that Ubisoft already expected you played the third and everything is a little too 'rushed' and most aspects seem like after thoughts and slapped into your face at random. There's very little explanation as to why things happen and virtually almost no backstory.\r\n\r\nEyecandy: Far Cry 4 is big. The foliage is beautiful and lush, the textures are clean and detailed, and the particles are full and believable. As far as the 'Next-Gen' look goes, I would say it could actually look just a tad bit better but that has to do with the engine, not the game. Animations are smooth, although straight ripped from the last game, and the framerate never dropped which was good. I did encounter a few bugs, but nothing game breaking, just funny ones.\r\n\r\nSoundDesign: The sounds of Kyrat aren't anything special, they're industry standard. The weapons have a nice variety, the 3D space is accurate, and the sound effects are good. The soundtrack isn't anything of a hitter either. It has some cool tracks that stand out, but most of the time it doesn't catch or amplify the mood as well as the third one did. Not bad, but not great. And the voice acting is too try hard. In all honesty the main character and antagonist were the best in the game.\r\n\r\nGameplay: The game plays exactly like Far Cry 3. And I honestly mean EXACTLY like Far Cry 3. It seemed like they didn't even update their scripting or touch the 'core' of the game. For instance, Kyrat is a very big place and your character's movement is at the same pace of Jason's who is used to a smaller island, so therefore Jason moves slower. In Kyrat, everything is bigger and more spread out, so to compensate, Ajay should move a little quicker. It's just little things like that. There's few new weapons and vehicles, but there are a variety of different animals. I played the game on hard mode, and comparatively to the last installment, this time around it was frustrating. The last Far Cry was challenging and had an awesome balance. When you died it was always fair and it was because of your own doing. In this one, hard mode was irritating. I even had a buddy watching me play and I quote, he said, \"Dude, straight up, even I'm getting mad watching you play this. That was bullsh!t.\" The RPG elements are back with the attributes of the Tiger and Elephant and it's all of the same skills from the previous and there's no backstory or tatau kind of thing to them. You just unlock them and get them.\r\n\r\nCo-op: This time around instead of doing a set of missions set aside for coop, this one is almost drop-in/out. You and your buddy can go anywhere in the world and tackle fortresses and camps and hunt and do all single player things together. It was awesome, but it wasn't \"fun\". There's really no incentive or specialty to play coop, it's kind of there just to be there. And the fact that there's no main co-op missions hinders the feature. My buddy joined my game and I was a lot farther than him so I already had outposts beat, animals hunted, and fortresses taken over, etc. so there was just nothing to do in my game, we had to start a new session in his world.", "likes": 1, "slug": "far-cry-4-written-review", "introduction": "I can almost guarantee you're only reading this because you're wondering if this Far Cry goes above and beyond what Ubisoft did in number three.

It's not that cheesy cel shading you'll catch in a Spongebob game, or intense like The Wind Waker, but it has a nice smooth graphical effect to it. The artwork, you know what, hold on... I want to put out on all developers right now that, if you're going to create an adaptation of something already critically acclaimed, keep as much originality to it as you can. This game had original artists, composers, writers, they kept the voice actors... bruh. Nothing was skewed, nothing was questionable, nothing was crappy. Except the cutscenes, they were a little cheap (and by cheap, I mean budget cheap). It was all collaboration work. And that to me, was the most impressive aspect of the game.\r\n\r\nSecond would be the bending. It was really cool and each bending style has its own actual play style. It wasn't just the same spin-flip-kick with different colors. For instance, Earth is your slow heavy hitter. Water is your long range, and airbending is your crowd control. I actually didn't like firebending, I thought it was the suckiest of the four. You can dodge, parry, all of that. Controls are pretty tight for the most part, but the mechanics are a little broken. Your \"true skill\" is tested within the pro bending arena, which I thought was pretty fun and addictive. And the game has a little bit of difficulty to it, not gonna lie.\r\n\r\nLow points of the game though would be enemy redundancy, the awkward temple-run mini game, the story, and the overall length. The story, while its own, takes place between seasons. If you haven't seen the show (I don't know who else would be playing the game if they haven't), then more than likely you'll be a little lost if you don't pay attention. But in all honesty, I would've waited a good two years if this game could've been fleshed out. The market isn't big enough for a AAA Korra game, and I'm alright with that.

The premise is creepy and I'm already in a world of mystery. I sit down in a chair, and then everything changes. I honestly don't know where to begin with this game. I would like to talk about the story, but at the same time I don't. Its pacing is perfect and the amount of detail to make the story believable was so overwhelming it was awesome. The visuals are an art style, if you know Bioshock then you know they're all about the whole throwback eras. Just one more distinction that makes this game stand out. The actor's execution was absolutely flawless. 2K picked a perfect cast and this is one of Troy Bakers best if you ask me. The actual sound design was unique, the sci-fi was believable, and all sounds were recorded in mono which I thought was smart because it never became a \"blah\" blend that Call of Duty is know for (in the sound world) and the sound stage and spatial awareness was great. Almost perfect. The actual gameplay and control scheme were recycled, and when this game came out, it was in the market when FPS's where at a high but it did work for the better and there was never a time where I would hit random buttons because I got confused in hairy situations. Controls were tight and I always knew what I was doing. I played it on Hard Mode from the get go and they were not messing around. Hard Mode is actually hard. Not irritating hard, but challenging hard. When you play it, you won't break your controller in a rage, you'll just go, \"damn!\" and pick right up where you left off. And also, if these plasmids were available to everyone, then why was it that the protagonist was the only one using them? That was the only gap I noticed in the game, and that was actually brought to my attention by someone else. The only downside to I thought to this game was not the ending, but the last level.

If the story was longer (and still as engaging), then it would easily be a nine.", "updated_at": 1446243960039, "positive_points": "Gameplay Formula\r\nAnimations", "content": "The main feature in ME:SOM is its Nemesis System, and it hits it right on the forge. Uruks rise to power and your objective is to liquidate them of their rank. The twist is that when you die, the same Orc that killed you will get promoted, and eventually even become a captain. Then, when you go back to get your revenge kill, you’ll cross blades and he will look you in the eye and say something like, “I killed you… I don’t understand.” Or they will spit in your face and say, “Coming back from the dead won’t phase me, I’ll make sure you stay dead this time!” It was badass and immersive. Each enemy also has their own different motives, personality, and array of strengths and weaknesses that actually add an interesting strategy element that could either help you or hurt you (depending on your environment). There was even a moment where I died, and the same guy that killed me rose up the ranks from a level six, to an ELEVEN. It was ridiculous. You’d best believe that I still made him my b*tch though.\r\n\r\nNarrative: The story is a revenge tale in which  your family is killed in front of you by some tall pale dude in a hood called The Black Hand and you’re goal is to kill him with the help of a wraith that possesses you. But, the only way to get to him is by killing through the ranks so you can work your way up to him and whoop that ass.\r\n\r\nEyeCandy: The first thing I want to talk about are the animations, the executions, combat, stealth, mounts, grappling, all of that! The way that all of the characters move and interact is incredible. Rarely did I ever see a repeat in animations, or two NPCs moving exactly the same when they were side by side. It was very smooth and very awesome. Graphically though, the game isn’t anything special. It does look good, and it does run well. There was a couple times where the frame rate would drop; but, it didn’t happen too often to where it would be a problem. There’s really not much to say about the graphics. To be honest, if you’ve played or seen a LOTR game, then you already know what it looks like, fifty shades of brown, and everything is in ruins.\r\n\r\nSound: The sound really isn’t that robust, but the voice acting is. I don’t even think I came across the same voice when I was fighting the captains because I know for a fact that I didn’t hear a repeat of dialogue. What stuck out the most though was battling the Warchiefs. As you start slaughtering your way up through the chain and you’re battling these Uruks, the Warchief will come out like Ben Stiller in Zoolander and have their own little intro sequence, kind of like in Borderlands. The music will start chanting their name, each with their own unique kind of jingle, and then you get down. Nothing else stuck out that was significant though. The battle music was basically that of Skyrim’s Dovahkiin theme and the SFX were generic, not all that custom, or Hi-Res, and the audio mix during the story’s cinematics sucked.\r\n\r\nGameplay: Now for the important part, the meat and potatoes. Shadow of Mordor’s gameplay is an exact copy pasta of two games, Assassin’s Creed, and the Batman Arkham series. The combat and level system is an EXACT MIRROR of Arkham, and almost everything else tries a little too hard to take from AC. It has the ‘Wraith World,’ which is just Eagle Vision. You scale these towers to hit a forge at the top and it’s SOM’s version of synchronizing. And at times the character will try and stick himself to a wall or ledge, or just not climb at all and it does get frustrating. The combat is good, but at times it was unresponsive, or there was a slight delay and the game wouldn’t register what button you pressed. This was especially bad when fighting a crowd of enemies.

I’m real big on the tech that goes behind these video games. Like the reflections and displacement of the water, the dynamic lighting, patterned and seamless textures, mocap and custom animations, things of that nature. And technologically, this game stands out bar none. Everything from the art and the visuals to the facial expressions. This game LOOKS incredible. Absolutely astounding. Every environment had the perfect feel and tone to it and everything fit just right. Even the sound design, while not superb, was still executed very well. I was pleasantly surprised with the effects and ambiance. Not too big on the soundtrack though. I actually thought the soundtrack was the weakest part of the game and I'm pretty big on music and soundtracks. But enough of that, let’s get down to the meat and potatoes.\r\n\r\nThe controls are somewhat simplistic. Not too fancy, not too many combination controls. Pretty straight forward. The actual gameplay is somewhat repetitive though. It’s a survival horror, I get it. But you could always tell when conflict was about to happen. Or at least when human interaction was about to happen. Ellie can’t swim? Ok, cool, just go get that convenient pallet that seems to be chilling in every single body of water around the world. Just an example of the little things like that.\r\n\r\nThe infected were relentless and brutal and felt somewhat unpredictable. They really had that unstable feel to them. But the confrontation with the infected (when I played) was a little broken. When you’re getting manhandled by a runner and you’re trying to get out of deaths grasp, there would be a clicker on standby, idling in the background, waiting to pounce. You see it in the background, and as soon as you got away, it would immediately cut to the death animation of the clicker. It went from one animation straight to the other with no in-between “air” time.  And I kid you not: I couldn’t press a single button in between the two. Even the fact that I had some shivs on deck didn’t matter. It could have been because I was on hard mode, but I felt a little bit cheated in that area.\r\n\r\nSecond, were the paths of the clickers. There were times where I’d keep having to go back to a checkpoint and I’d be crouched down at one place, and the clicker would go right past me like my sneak skill was legendary. But then when I died (for whatever reason) I would reload my checkpoint and go back to that same exact hiding spot. Then MAGICALLY the thing knows where I am and I’m dead. Then, when I did it again, nothing would happen. Blended right in like JP from Grandma’s Boy. I mean, ok.  A little frustrating, but not a game breaker.\r\n\r\nAs far as the story goes, I thought it was very predictable. And to be honest, I never felt the chemistry between Joel and Ellie. It just didn’t feel natural. It was like they had a good rapport. It felt very redone. Troy Baker’s performance (mocap and voice-acting) was really good. And Ashley Johnson’s voice really stuck out, definitely kid like, but just a semitone out of place but that’s purely my opinion on the voice. Anyways, I called almost all the outcomes of the scenarios (even though I played the game late, I still made sure to stay away from any spoilers). The secondary characters were my favorite. They stuck out more than the main characters did and I felt that the relationship between them and the protagonists were a lot stronger than the main two.", "likes": 0, "slug": "the-last-of-us-written-review", "introduction": "I didn’t get to play The Last of Us until about a week after it came out and while I was waiting to play it I kept seeing memes, commercials, reviews, peer talk, etc hype up the game.

Teams are organized into red and blue teams, and games typically are restricted to a 12-minute timer or a three-cap victory.  Players are either red or blue \"balls\", circles \"rolling\" on the play area.\r\nPlayers can use boosts, a handful of powerups, and team-sensitive gates to strategically navigate the map and defend their flag while attempting to capture the enemy flag and return it to theirs to \"cap\" and score a point.  \r\nThere are two main variations to gameplay.  The first is traditional CTF, with each team trying to capture the enemy flag (by \"rolling\" over it) and returning it to their base to cap (by \"rolling\" over their flag while carrying the enemy flag).  If any opposing player touches the flag-carrier, they are popped and the flag is instantaneously returned to the defending base.  The second variation is a neutral-flag gameplay mode, in which a yellow flag is located at the centre of the map and players must try and carry it to a scoring area at the enemy end of the map. Contact between a defender and the enemy flag-carrier causes the flag to change hands to the defender that made contact.\r\nThe powerups are as follows:\r\nNote that powerups \"pups\" respawn sixty seconds after a player has rolled over them.\r\nTagpro: when a player rolls over the tagpro powerup, a green circle appears around the edge of their \"ball\". They can now pop \"tag\" any player, not just the enemy flag carrier.\r\nRolling Bomb: When a player rolls over the rolling bomb powerup, their ball adopts a smoking appearance.  If any enemy player comes into contact with them, the \"bomb\" explodes, and the enemy player is launched a distance away.  This is useful for a flag carrier, because it grants one touch of immunity to being tagged.\r\nJuke Juice: TagPro is all about juking enemy players, so juke juice is particularly useful.  It provides increased acceleration and speed.\r\nTagPro can be played competitively, and various leagues exist.  Most players play in \"pubs\", games with randomized teams in location oriented servers.\r\nThere is an in-game chat function that provides team-private and general chat.  \r\nPlayers can earn flairs, little symbols that accompany their ball along with their username, for achieving levels or special event achievements.  The level of a player is displayed along with their username, and is earned based on their number of wins.\r\nPlayers can form groups in the servers, and move from game to game as a group of players.\r\nFor special dates, (like Easter or April Fools Day) the developers will sometimes introduce a new gamemode for a day or two.\r\nThis review doesn't encompass everything, and I apologize for any errors.", "likes": 5, "slug": "beautiful-simplicity", "introduction": "I'd describe myself as a casual gamer, and never really got into console gaming.

If you are an RTS nut like myself then you probably have already picked up grey goo and if you haven't I would recommend doing so. If you are a little hesitant about dropping the full retail price then wait for the first significant price drop as Grey Goo is a game that won't punish late adopters like Star Craft 2 and will still feature that brilliantly crafted single player story.", "updated_at": 1428791770760, "positive_points": "Interesting playable races that mix up the RTS formula\r\nGreat control scheme\r\nFully fleshed out story with beautiful CGI cutscenes", "content": "Grey Goo is a brand new intellectual property, something that feels all too rare nowadays and even rarer is a real time strategy game. I originally thought the name was silly until I did some googling and came across the hypothetical end of the world scenario where rampant self replicating nano-sized robots  would devour every living thing on the planet in the search for  greater material with which to build more of itself. This piqued my interest. Then it was released that the creators of this game were video game developers Petroglyph Games made up of the original members of Westwood Studios, the creators of the Command and Conquer series. The prodigal sons had returned. Needless to say this game has been riding the hype train amongst lovers of the RTS genre ever since its announcement, as RTS lovers have been left wanting for games to play, I mean unless you have some kind of genetic mutation that makes you immune to the effects of carpal tunnel syndrome and are still playing Star Craft 2.\r\n\r\nGrey Goo is thankfully a good game, perhaps even very good with the potential to become excellent if its developers continue to support the game and listen to the community that has quickly grown up around the game. Like its spiritual predecessors C&C and Star Craft it comprises of three different factions, a technologically advanced human race that has a horde of artificial intelligent controlled machines to wage war with, the alien Beta's that use the power of industry to build powerful mechanised war vehicles and lastly the most interesting of them the titular grey goo who are giant blobs of nano-machines that absorb all in their path to replicate and spread throughout the map. While the humans and Beta ultimately play very similarly to each other and would be immediately recognisable to any passing RTS gamer with strong emphasis on base building, managing their economy and producing the correct variations of unit types the goo is an entirely different beast altogether and something that I haven't seen done before. \r\n\r\nThe goo instead of having different  centres of production and resource gathering have just one unit called the mother goo that acts as a kind of mobile base, heavy unit and resource producer all in one. The mother goo moves between resource pools to collect material which it then uses to produce either another mother goo, light or heavy goos or an ultimate unit that wreaks devastation anywhere it goes. the light and heavy goos themselves can then morph into a slew of other units for specific tasks such as anti air or artillery support and can all be done in the heat of battle. The goo has a weakness, however, in that to effectively gather resources the numerous mother goos that you will ultimately have must be micromanaged much more than the other two races.\r\n\r\nThe humans have a strong focus on base building and have the odd mechanic that all of their buildings must be linked by power struts connected to the central base, while this at first seems unduly restricting it immediately becomes clear that without it humans would be near unstoppable. Humans enjoy a wide range of defensive turrets that the other two races are noticeably lacking in and gain access to strong air units remarkably fast making them masters of both defence and fast offense. The centralised base building ultimately makes it harder for the humans to maintain their supply lines as factories must be built close to the central hub while defenseless 'worker' units must instead move across the map and into harms way. The alien Betas are a mixture of both the goo and the humans in that they have the ability to build structures anywhere they have line of sight meaning that they can spread rapidly across the map but each structure must be connected to a central power hub that is generally an easy target. \r\n\r\nGrey Goo also features something that RTS games have been severely lacking in recent years being an excellent single player campaign. In the same vein as C&C the story of grey goo is shown through excellent videos before and after each mission while its predecessor benefitted from gloriously campy live action clips grey goo has beautifully rendered cg cut scenes. The story is well scripted and almost unbelievably contains characters that I actually care about. The control system has also been vastly improved from these earlier titles with the creation of a quick key control scheme based on the wasd keys which feels incredibly natural and makes you feel like a bad ass StarCraft 2 player in no time at all.\r\n\r\nI started off talking about grey goo with the statement that it is a good game but unfortunately it isn't great. I ran into slight fps drops towards the end of some games where the units involved can number in the thousands as each faction not only has its little worker bees scurrying around for loot but also the hundred or so combat units clashing against one another, it only happened a handful of times but I suspect those with battlestations even a little worse off than myself will experience issues. The longevity of the game is also an issue as I have put approximately 40 hours into the game as of my writing this and am starting to slow down as there are limited official maps so far and many of my online games all fell very much the same. This will undoubtedly improve in the coming weeks as more people begin to play, however, it's something that was constantly on my mind as I played.\r\n", "likes": 0, "slug": "this-goo-will-stick-around", "platform": 6, "created_at": 1428791770375, "negative_points": "Feels poorly optimised, however, may be improved on later with updates\r\nThe formula doesn't have the staying power that other RTS games arguably have", "id": 1493, "game": 8232, "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/grey-goo/reviews/this-goo-will-stick-around", "rating_category": 2, "username": "Daniel"}, {"title": "Tagpro is ridiculously fun", "views": 181, "category": 1, "conclusion": "For a free game, it honestly can't be beat!", "updated_at": 1428792032198, "positive_points": "Able to create/use userscript\r\nDevs are responsive and play\r\nEveryone is on level playing field", "content": "Tagpro is basically as a simple of a game as you can get, while still being really, really, REALLY fun.

No? \r\n\r\nAlright, let me explain. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe opening to Bloodborne is actually quite different from the openings of previous From Software games. There's a short cutscene that prompts you to create your character, but no opening cutscene explaining the lore of the world. Speaking of the character creator- it's amazing. You can almost (note the almost, because some games just have ugly characters) always judge a character creator on how much of an abomination you can make the default character into, and by god, have some abominations been made. But they aren't all ugly. The Joker is a popular design, as is Abraham Lincoln, who's evidently been referred to Yharnam after his time as a Vampire hunter. My character is modeled after the Norse God Odin. The character creator allows for complete control over all facial dimensions, much like Skyrim. That's a big step up from Dark Souls' creator. After your contract is completed, you're almost ready to face Yharnam. The werewolf fight is somewhat of a supposed-to-lose fight, but if you manage to beat him with the strange karate chops your character makes with their bare hands, you can proceed to the first level. As soon as you die, you're given your choice of three trick weapons and two firearms.\r\n\r\nI would love to elaborate on the game's levels, but Bloodborne is the sort of game you want to experience on your own. You don't want to know what's around the corner. You don't want to know what the next boss will look like or even what their name is. I suggest you be careful with youtube videos as well. Unraveling Yharnam's mysteries is much more satisfying on your own. Just know that you're in for one of the most thrilling, mysterious, and addicting experiences ever had with a game. I'll talk about the game's mechanics to avoid any spoilers.\r\n\r\nI was never a fan of Souls combat, honestly. It was quite a shame, as I really enjoyed almost every other aspect of the games. Bloodborne has changed that. The game rewards fast-paced combat. There's no shields (barring one put in as a joke), rolling is replaced with dashing when locked on, health can be regenerated if you manage you hit a nearby enemy fast enough (before you say \"streamlining\", using this mechanic forces you to be greedy and gets you killed often), and you can move, albeit slowly, while healing. Fights are more frantic and every small mistake you make is extremely punishing. There are less weapons, but every weapon is a trick weapon. This means the weapon has two forms, ensuring your fighting style is always unpredictable. Firearms are wielded in the left hand, and range from a small pistol to a cannon. Firearms exist mainly for the sake of parrying and riposting, which requires you to fire your weapon while your enemy is mid-attack animation, causing them to stagger, whereupon you press R1 and rip their organs out with your right hand. It looks just as badass as it sounds.\r\n\r\nBloodborne is incredibly atmospheric from beginning to end. The NPCs are all well voice acted, the graphics are astounding, and the level design is top-notch, much better than Dark Souls II's. The clothing on your character's back blows in the wind and flaps around gently with every movement you make. Many of the bosses are quite hairy or have something hanging off of them that moves beautifully as they attack. Blood simply pours out of enemies as you slash them, soaking your character as you slaughter more and more of them. One incredible detail I noticed was that getting covered in blood while wearing a full mask results in only the area around your eyes becoming blood-stained. Bloodborne simply does everything it sets out to do incredibly well without faltering or even seeming a bit over-the-top. One of the greatest things about Miyazaki and his team at From is that they can design broken worlds so well- Yharnam feels like a lived-in place that's run into some really, really bad times, much like New Londo did in Dark Souls. You might get used to dealing with a beast or two, you might think to yourself \"this isn't too bad\", but Bloodborne will change that. Bloodborne will never leave you comfortable.\r\n\r\nThe game's issues are mainly technical shortcomings. The framerate often dips, and while I personally think it's more stable than Dark Souls' framerate (nothing can be worse than Blighttown) it's definitely noticeable.  PVP is very hit-or-miss- it can take 10 seconds to find somebody else or 10 minutes, and the netcode is a bit shoddy regardless. There are a few covenants but none of them really make significant changes to the PVP meta. PVP may sound like a bit of a disappointment, but the core mechanics save it. The PVP is fast-paced and exhilarating and the lack of sword-and-boarding and cheese magic makes it more skill based than ever before (note: there still is \"magic\" in the game, it's just used less often).

From quaint villages to draconic strongholds, there is very rarely a time when a room is not filled with chroma across the spectrum\r\n\r\nThe combat is also incredibly well-polished, and require the player to take a deceptively active role in the details of battles, despite a simple turn-based system. Action commands ensure the player is always responsible for the outcome of battles, while stylish moves hide secrets in the combat that players will discover over time. The variance of these commands ensure that fighting with different partners feels very different.\r\n\r\nA remarkably deep character customization system ties with combat to leave the player with even more diverse character builds to create. The badge system allows characters to choose combat buffs or new moves in the form of badges, which take a quantity of badge points that may be increased by leveling up.\r\n\r\nThe aforementioned basics may be found in many great role-playing games, but the one quality that sets The Thousand Year Door apart is its world.

A 2D ball voyages to the other side of the map, grabs the flag, and brings it back. However, it has been implemented in such a way that creates vast strategy, often forcing split-second decisions that can dramatically alter the outcome of the match. These strategies come to fruition in three main ways: human enemies, human teammates, and the physics.\r\nWhen trying to bring the flag back, one must beat the enemies in a race of sorts to their own base. This can be done by taking the optimum paths, tricking the opponents, or by simply outmaneuvering them. It requires an extreme amount of situational awareness that can only be developed over time.\r\nBeing good on your own is great, but your teammates can either carry you to victory or cause your defeat. Teamwork is vital, and this is done by protecting the flag carrier or protecting your own flag. It is also very important to have a full team, as each new player greatly increases the chance of victory. But with a lot of ways to kill your own teammates (added fun), be careful not to let the other team have an advantage.

There are five cars on the map that if you take control of them and drive the cars really fast you start gaining points. This adds a lot of car chases to the game.

Staring as one of people being preserved, you are woken up from your cryostasis in a preservation pod, finding out that you're the only one alive, once leaving the pod you find yourself in a desolate world surrounded by mutant, bandits and a group called the Authority. \r\n\r\nThe story is non-existent including your character's personality, back history, or even an authority and reason for yourself. The character being played is nothing more than a blank slate, ID Software (though never really praised for its story) failed horribly on this aspect of the game, most of the time, nothing was interesting about what you were doing or why you were doing it, every time you go out to fight, the sense of achievement is seldom. Even though ID Software tries to create some dynamic characters to interact with, all of them seem to have this inauthentic feel to their personality, though their designs of the character and clothing fit the bill of someone who has a certain type of personality, the dialogue and the voice acting is forced. When interacting with characters in a main mission, the game forces you to be with them at all time when giving their briefing, listening to what they're saying, there's no skipping these moments nor is there anything interesting for them to say.Some quests and mission such as racing are also required to get through the game. ID Software could have done better. \r\nBut looking at some positives, RAGE's gunplay makes the game very enjoyable to play. Featuring the generic pistol, shotgun, sub machine gun and a few apocalyptic weapon. Each weapon packs it own punch, the fights and the AI interaction with the enemies you face can be a fantastic experience, each enemy has their own intelligence when fighting. This is possibly the best aspect to the game. \r\nAudio is crisp and sounds great to listen to, with most sounds being quite authentic for the genre. The graphics are another positive, the developers have put extra special care into making some of the best graphics at the time, there's much artistic detail put into every nook and cranny of the environment (even if it's somewhat generic).

The combat aspect of the game is polished to such a state that many people rightfully consider BOD to be the defining game of its genre.

Definitely one of the best videogame soundtracks (such a shame that it wasn't released separately).\r\n\r\nGreat replayability.", "content": "Let me get this straight, right from the first paragraph – Blade Of Darkness isn't a walk in the park. It's challenging and fairly unforgiving, brutally punishing those who rush happily at their first enemy with a sword in their hand by chopping their head off. Severance requires quite a bit of discipline, caution and patience – but if you possess all that, it's going to be one of the most rewarding and fun games you've ever played.\r\n\r\nIf I had to summarize this game with just one word, it would have to be 'combat'. BOD puts combat above everything else, combat is its heart and core. The combat mechanics were fairly revolutionary at the time of its release; while the fighting system of most other hack-n-slash games of that time (Enclave, Rune...) consisted of the player's character jumping around and click-spamming the enemies, combat in Blade Of Darkness instead resembles a fighting game like, say, Mortal Kombat – although not as hectic and far more strategic. \"A fighting game in third-person view\" would be a fairly fitting description; while the camera is kept behind the character's back at all times, the combat consists of blocking, attacking and performing keyboard combos – and keeping an eye on the character's stamina and everything else going on around you, because the other enemies won't hesitate to attack you while you're busy trying not to get killed by that one troll with a poisoned sword in front of you. Every fight is truly an adrenaline rush – no matter how confident you are, the harsh reality is that the ork around the next corner can chop you to pieces just as easily as that fearsome minotaur that you've just defeated.\r\n\r\nTo make things better (or, perhaps, worse, depending on how you look at it), the movement and combat feels heavy and slow-ish, making it impossible to just jump and click your way out of every situation. The characters can indeed dodge and jump out of the way of the enemy's blade if you're quick enough to react, but if you hope that you can pull that off in a small room with a few enemies, you're in for a rude awakening. Every blow and every slash of the sword feels heavy, no matter if it's your club hitting an enemy knight or his sword cutting through your flesh. It's outright impossible to simply click your foes to death. Like it or not, you'll have to learn to fight efficiently and skillfully.\r\n\r\nBut once you master this skill, every fight becomes a beautiful dance rather than a challenge. The succession of dodges, quick stabs, blocks and well-timed combos is an entrancing and captivating sight, something that turns the fight into a product of intuition rather than precise calculation. Has the enemy started doing that particular attack that exposes his side? Go for a quick swing from the left. Or raise your weapon for a second, blocking his move, and counter-attack with a fierce diagonal cut. Rebel Act did an amazing job, making the gameplay fluid and intuitive, hard enough to keep your teeth clenched but incredibly rewarding when it all pays off at the end and you successfully chop the head off that ork and watch it fly across the room with spurts of blood painting the walls red.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of that, the game is notoriously violent and outright gory – something that only adds to the satisfaction after defeating a difficult enemy. Heads, limbs and pieces of torsos are all perfectly detachable when it comes to sharp weapons applied to them, with obligatory blood pools completing the picture – and the playable characters aren't safe from having their limbs chopped off, too. Furthermore, the hacked off gibs can be picked up and carried around and even used as weapons in their own right – not particularly efficient weapons, sure, but definitely intimidating ones. The same applies to just about any other object of right size in the game – anything from bones to stools can be picked up and used to hit enemies with.\r\n\r\nBut it would be a lie to say that all that this game has to offer is combat. Oftentimes, you'll find yourself running around temples and tombs, palaces and ancient ruins trying to solve a mystery or (most often) open a particular gate or door to advance through the level. A game with a brilliant combat system but terrible location design would be a huge disappointment – thankfully, Severance isn't one. Whether it's a foggy circular fortress or a creepy island of the dead, ruins of an ancient city in the middle of the rainforest or a sand-swept temple in the desert, all the locations are absolutely beautiful and atmospheric – and, let's admit it, that is quite a compliment for a game released in 2001. Some of the architecture and sceneries are jaw-droppingly gorgeous, making you stop all the running and fighting for a minute just to admire the view. Drawing influence from various cultures around the world (mainly those located in the Fertile Crescent, but reaching as far as India and even South America for one location), the level design has amazing style to it, fully immersing the player into the world of the game. At the same time, with all their richness and beauty, the locations never feel safe. Both the dark and gloomy levels and the bright and sun-caressed ones have that feeling of disturbance to them, making you look behind your back every now and then and expect a foe to jump at you from any recess in the wall. Occasionally, Blade Of Darkness takes a nosedive straight into the horror genre, making you visit dark creepy dungeons and towers of necromancers – and even a pitch-black crypt once, where you have to fight through hordes of mummified zombies in the flickering light of your torch that has an annoying tendency of burning out.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of torches and pitch-black crypts, Blade Of Darkness loves playing with light and shadows. It was one of the first games – if not the first one – that featured real-time volumetric shadows, and, as if that was not enough, shadows from several sources of light at once – which is truly an impressive feature for a game from 2001. The graphics of Severance were fantastic at the time of its release – for 2001, it was essentially what Crysis was for 2007, a benchmark and a new standard for videogame graphics. In addition to the games of shadows mentioned above, the graphics quality plays a defining role in the beauty of architecture and landscapes described in the previous paragraph. When you see a sacred temple of a deity, sculpted with meticulous attention to detail, or a cold fortress of the knights atop the mountain, with patches of snow covering passageways between its high stone walls, it is sometimes hard to believe that something this beautiful and detailed was made in 2001. In this regard, the game has aged astonishingly well, enemy models being just about the only thing that immediately doesn't look modern at first glance.\r\n\r\nMusic is something else that adds to the atmosphere greatly. It suits the events of the game perfectly; it's rich and beautiful when you're exploring deserted areas and taking in the magnificent views, it's tense and exciting when you're battling a difficult enemy, it's epic and solemn during some of the game's most climactic scenes and fights. It can be chilling and creepy in dark dungeons, but then it will smoothly change to a lighter ambient score once you make it to an outdoor area. Overall, sans some somewhat cheesy suspense effects, the sound design of Severance is brilliant – it's definitely a shame that the game's score was never released separately. While all the sounds and music of BOD are easily accessible in the game's folder, the audio quality is quite mediocre, some of the music pieces being mono wavs sampled at 22 kHz, others – 128 kbps mp3s.\r\n\r\nThe player has four playable characters to choose from, each character specializing in his or her types of weapons and fighting style. Each of the characters has their own unique starting level and their own story, although the storyline differences between them disappear fairly early into the game. Most new players love the Barbarian, with his two-handed swords and cool-looking attacks, although he might be a bit too difficult for the first-time players. A balanced choice for a first playthrough would be the Knight, with his efficient use of shields and easy to master combos. Additionally, his starting level was the one bundled with the demo of the game, so it was meticulously polished and demonstrates the game's mood and gameplay features very well. The Amazon is also a good choice for first-timers, though playing with her feels almost cheatingly easy at times, with her long-range attacks and the ability to quickly roll far enough out of harm's way (although her starting level is actually quite the opposite of 'cheatingly easy'!). I definitely wouldn't recommend playing with the Dwarf on your first playthrough, though, since playing with him has a very high chance of rage quits and throwing the keyboard out of the window in frustration. In any case, once you've completed the game with one character, what could be better than starting it over with another one, just to see how well you'll manage this time? BOD has fantastic replayability. Besides, over the years, the fan community has created countless mods and singleplayer maps to check out, some of these maps rivaling the original campaign in their detail and complexity.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the only serious downside of the game is its story. It's not that the storyline is inherently bad – on the contrary, the game is set in a world heavily influenced by Zoroastrian teachings and the Earth-that-was a few dozen centuries ago; the story is a prime example of the monomyth found in many cultures and has a couple of (admittedly, fairly cliched) plot twists. The real problem is that the storyline could have easily not existed here at all. Most of the time, all you're doing is going from one door to another, trying to find keys and gems while fighting abominations and evil guys and admiring the atmosphere – and wondering why you're here. It's not that the story is nonsentical, has plot holes or is unrelated to what's actually happening on the screen – but the only times when it actually surfaces are level intros and intermission screens with the narrator saying a few words about the place, and occasional cutscenes that are few and far between. To figure out what's actually going on, the player has to pay rigorous attention to these small bits of information, then piece them together and speculate on things that were left unsaid or just mentioned briefly in the passing. If you go through the trouble of actually doing that, the storyline does indeed make sense, justifying everything that happens (or, at least, most of it) and making the ending truly satisfying. If not... The storyline could have just as easily been something along the lines of \"everything in this world wants to kill you\" and it would have affected the gameplay just the same.\r\n\r\nSome people have found the controls to be difficult at first, though not exactly awkward. The core feature of BOD – combat – relies on the attack and block functions and combinations of movement keys that result in directional attacks and weapon-specific combos. Lack of strafe outside of combat situations is something that many have found confusing and unexpected.\r\n\r\nTo conclude the list of downsides, the game's development was somewhat rushed during the last few months of production, leading to some gameplay features and parts of storyline being abandoned. Various signs of this are noticeable throughout the game, such as the presence of a different type of bow that you never get to use, the aforementioned heavily fragmented storyline and various minor bugs that may happen every now and then. There are major bugs as well, but nowadays most of them are caused by the game being pretty dated already and not always running perfectly on modern machines and modern Windows. One of the features that definitely suffered from the rushed development is multiplayer, which was left not as exciting as it could potentially be and clearly underdeveloped – nowadays, it requires a considerable amount of effort to set up a match since the game supports only LAN connections; a VPN software like Hamachi would come in handy in this case.\r\n\r\nThe game has aged fairly well and will sometimes work out of the box on a modern version of Windows like Windows 7. Players experiencing crashes, glitched fonts and such are advised to google \"OpenGL Raster\" for Blade Of Darkness – it's a fan-made (as far as I know) alternative to DirectX Raster DLLs that come bundled with the game; OpenGL offers far better stability these days (the game might look a bit dark with it, so you may have to adjust the brightness and gamma additionally in the game). Occasionally, some cutscenes will not work as intended (usually resulting in the character walking in circles and other similar issues); this can usually be solved by temporarily switching back to DirectX Raster (even if only for this one cutscene) or toggling VSync (it's the \"swap buffers\" parameter in the \"Misc\" tab in the OpenGL Raster settings window). If you're having troubles with the fog being too thick to see anything in some locations, google \"Fog Fix\" (sometimes spelled \"FogFix\") which is a minor mod that solves this problem (it doesn't affect gameplay). Lastly, just for the record, the game is locked at the 4:3 aspect ratio so if you'll set up a widescreen resolution for it, everything on the screen will be simply stretched horizontally. As of early 2015, there's still no fix for this, although the developer of the ENB mod for BOD (google \"Blade Of Light\" if you're into that sort of thing) is currently experimenting with some ideas. If you're reading this review in the far future, go take a look if they succeeded. The best (though not always available) solution these days is to set a 4:3 resolution like 1440x1080 for a 1920x1080 monitor and then choose letterboxing the image instead of always forcing fullscreen stretching in the settings of your graphics card or your monitor.\r\n\r\nDespite these flaws, Blade Of Darkness is truly unrivaled when it comes to gameplay. If you haven't heard about this hidden gem and if you don't mind a game that won't let you stroll through it casually, you should definitely give it a try. These days, it can be obtained on GOG for just a few bucks.

It's as amazing as it sounds. Even for the time it came out, it's still awkward, and never feels fully comfortable. The game also always displays: Weapon, Ammo, Condition. I guess they knew since it would be in First Person, you couldn't really give off any indication of your condition.

The reputation behind the game was its massive delays since 1999 as the company revised/reconstructed the game to make it what they believed was a game worthy of playing. Headfirst Productions did in fact achieve something out this, though many problem coming with it too. This game is a diamond in the 'rough' part and the rough is hard to avoid. The game is plagued with bugs, some in the gameplay and other segments that are impossible to pass unless without a certain patch, code or even the right version of Windows (XP version) to run it. It personally left me puzzled on why the company couldn't iron out all the bugs in time but surely there were reasons. Another problem is the game hasn't aged well. The character models are quite bizarre to look at, sometimes almost alien (even normal models), the audio design is quite weak such as the gun sounds and some environmental effects.\r\n\r\nSo what's so good about such a game with many flaws? When overlooking the 'rough' (I mentioned earlier), and seeing the diamond, Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of The Earth is a fantastic experience due to how well written dialogue, characters personality, immersive and frightening it is to be embodied where it sets you in. \r\n\r\nThe story is probably the second strongest aspect of the game, you play as a detective called Jack Walters, a man with a reputation for solving crimes even if there wasn't any evidence. His character is a textbook one but is later developed more through out his witnessing of violence and horror. He is encountered by something horrific after investigating a cultic group, he is later locked up in the asylum due to terrifying event he experience with the cult, though later released from the asylum only to be called up to look for a missing person in the isolated town of Innsmouth. Venturing to the location he unravels a sinister group in which the whole town has kept a secret. \r\n\r\nThe story unravels more and more as you play as Jack, reading notes and books on the towns history shows that there's a morbid side that is very effective if you're sucked into it. The story never stops giving you more detail about what's going on, all the time the new information given about the town and its people, provides a sickening feeling that is uneasy on the mind. \r\n\r\nCall of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of The Earth story isn't the best part about this game, but it is the atmosphere, that the developers made to make the world seem more believable. The world you're set in, is a dark and messy place, the design and textures of old rusted houses, factories and the sickening look of the Innsmouth people all help greatly with the unsettling atmosphere. \r\nWhen utilised with the gameplay, there's a effective aspect to this. The game for the first-half, makes you powerless to fend off against enemies. You are attacked by a mob, in which you cannot do anything to defend yourself, nor can you hide, instead the only option is to run away. The game doesn't make it easy for you to do some, your enemies are fast and powerful, sometimes you'll have to lock doors and bar them with anything you can find the room to buy yourself a few seconds, the game never stop making it intense. The other aspect is the gunplay which make your character though a little overpowered when fighting against certain enemies. Though this may seem like a down side to the horror; it doesn't!\r\nThe game is very much Lovecraftian (well it is based on a Lovecraft lore), it implements a mental system to the game, in which traumatic experience will send your character into a paranoid and weakened psychological state. Your character will start whispering to himself and the games visuals will start to get messy and hazy. Such implementation is executed perfectly.

But before 7554, no one had any single idea who is Emobi Games. So when they announced 7554, everyone was so hyped that we finally make a real game, not another rip-off rubbish from any other game. The hype hit the Vietnamese internet community with tons of rumours and questions, people even thought that the game never make it because Vietnamese censorship. However, here we are, we made it after a lot of supporting for the company. So I definitely feel that it deserves my respect even if it is a potato.\r\n\r\n- Experience:\r\n\r\n+Pros: \r\n\r\nDecent graphic, sounds which really did \"revive\" Indochina war from 1945 with creepy old town, rice field, jungle road and military camp. It did enough to recreate the Vietnam's environment from those war days. It is really amazing that we can look at the French colonial Vietnam once again in modern time and many of those building in early part of the game still here now. Even the Metropole hotel is still a hotel nowadays. The weapon arsenal was alright I guess, it could have been much better.\r\n\r\n+Cons:\r\n\r\nHonestly, the graphic is definitely from Call of Duty, because they used the same engine to develop the game. It makes me first feel like I was playing a huge community mod. Some sound bugs and graphic bugs did \"bug\" me somehow, although there was no crash, I some time stuck on the top of a truck or between tree. \r\n\r\nThe AI was not that well made though, they were quiet poor. When you face them and try a meelee, they go for instant kill on you. So it was quiet weird. \r\n\r\nStoryline was okay but it could have been done 10 times better because the plot was very potential.\r\n\r\n+ Effort: (10/10)\r\n\r\nEmobi Games was brave to announce that their game will be sold $12 for each copy. Because in Vietnam, copyrights infringement is 98% so a lot of people will basically wait for crack which made Emobi to decide to sell their game cheaply in hope more people will buy it. However, 7554 still a total failure from them. They spent around $750.000 to make the game and they were only able to sold $50.000. They later withdrew from independence offline game and now concentrate on online MMORPG. Which I am pretty sad for that. I wish Emobi Games did not only launch the game in Vietnam but also launch it in overseas, they could maybe make some profit out of 7554.\r\n\r\n- Conclusion:\r\n\r\n If any major company made 7554, they would be happy if I give them a 4/10. However, I actually feel for the developer and their restless effort so I decided to give them a 7/10. If you have a spare $12 somewhere, you can go and give it a try.

This game comes from the age of linear RPGs, when you followed a story and you liked it. The game features a number of side missions which do an amazing job of fleshing out the world and can change how NPCs view you. This game takes place in four hubs, where you can find side quests and generally romp around, and a number of smaller areas you go to for main quests where you have more specific goals. The story is very well-grounded, especially for a game about vampires, and never tries to reach above its means. It's pretty close to perfect.\r\n\r\nGraphics\r\n-------------\r\nThe graphics of this game aren't terribly impressive, since the game is eleven years old. However, they follow a consistent and interesting aesthetic which gives flavor the the world and really brings the game to life.\r\n\r\nThere are a couple of graphical glitches I've noticed:\r\n- The first is that, while in the sewers, the water reflections will often forget to update, meaning the water reflects the world from one point of view and you see the world from an entirely different point of view. It looks pretty weird and annoyed me a lot.\r\n- The second glitch is that objects near the top and bottom of the screen will often disappear. This includes things like parts of buildings and the ground. I suspect the developers implemented a visibility culling algorithm, so they didn't render objects that were outside of the player's field of view, but they're culling too many things. This issue amused me.\r\n- The third is more of a performance issue than a graphics issue, but it's related to graphics so I'll put it here. Whenever particles appear on screen, the game experiences massive frame drops. Normally, I can run this game at 60+ frames per second. Throw in some particles, and I get like 10. No joke. This isn't too much of an issue, since there aren't many particle systems in the game, but if you use some of your vampire powers in first-person mode you get this massive slowdown, and whenever supernatural enemies die they explode into particles which looks cool but, again, causes massive framerate drops. V:TM:B was built with the Source engine, which didn't have any sort of particle system until Half-Life 2: Episode 2, so I suspect whoever at Troika programmed the particle systems for this game did a pretty bad job of it.\r\n\r\nAudio\r\n------------\r\nThis game is from 2004, so the audio isn't super amazing high-quality noiseless recordings, but that's okay. I rather liked the way the dialogue sounded. I'm not enough of an audio engineer to describe it very well, but it fits very well into this game.\r\n\r\nThe audio does have an issue that holds my rating back. When you wear headphones, it sounds a lot like the game plays the dialogue tracks separately in each ear, with one ear's audio delayed slightly from the other ear's. This sounds bad and hurts the overall audio quality.\r\n\r\nControls\r\n-----------\r\nThis is the game's weakest point. Although movement feels pretty alright, combat is awful. When you click to attack, if the attack animation, enemy getting hit animation, sound of the enemy getting hit, and the number that tells you how much damage you did all occur within one second of each other, you're pretty lucky. What's interesting is that, when enemies attack you, those things pretty much happen at the same time. What's also interesting is that pretty much every time an enemy hits you, you stagger back, so if you're fighting a group of enemies who would be no trouble individually, they'll attack you in sequence so you stay staggered and can't do anything. It's really annoying, especially since you only sometimes stagger enemies.\r\n\r\nI played a melee character, so I can't comment on the gun play.\r\n\r\nFun\r\n-----------\r\nThis game is definitely fun. The storyline is incredibly compelling, and the world makes sense in a way that few other games have accomplished.

Half-Life is literally a game changer from the get-go of the game. Valve were careful in their crafting their storytelling (not their detail or depth but expression), filled with visual cues and actions, that express what's going on the game's universe. In fact, Half-Life's protagonist Gordon Freeman, is merely a pawn in a large game of chess. His character is somewhat of a odd choice. Freeman is neither the action hero nor the soldier in which previous FPS titles have been using. Freeman's role as a scientist, contradicts and breaks the stereotype of action protagonists in FPS'. \r\n\r\nThe action in the game is much different to previous FPS' in the genre. Half-Life pushes a more cinematic style and form similar to that of films. The experience engaged in the game are: Military gun fights, disaster like events, fighting aliens and even up against special ops forces. The game make you feel like you're in an action film, similar to that of John Woo films. The action though sometimes comes to a halt as the game lets you use some brain power (puzzles segements) to pass certain areas. Half-Life perfectly accomplishes this with action. Other things like AI is brilliant for the time as well, especially with military soldiers will try to flank your position by talking to each other. Most of the human AI are never walking targets, they all want to stay alive and desperately do so.   \r\nThe game is a marvel in its gameplay, though some may consider to be a bit outdated. The main flaw in the game has nothing to do with the experience provided, instead but the story. Though the story expresses itself in many ways, the game doesn't pack as much punch to be compared to any point and click adventure of the time.

The game is nevertheless different in which will have different reactions for audience looking for a particular gameplay. For one thing, Hitman Absolution may not be an appealing game for those who have played the games in the previous series (like myself). What has made it quite a disappointment is how they have moulded the gameplay more story focused way. This of course is not a flaw of the game, but for the Hitman series being focusing on how you execute the mission was what made the Hitman series so stimulating in the first place. IO Interactive executed this part poorly and hindered the main focus of what the game was about originally. Nevertheless the story is much more stronger than it predecessors. Again you play as Agent 47 trying to protect/save the girl from those wanting to use her for their own evil deeds. Agent 47's character is much more reflective in this game, many moments in cutscenes, shows the humanity that 47 possesses within himself. Though quite odd for the series, this brings a new perspective on 47's role as an assassin. \r\n\r\nGameplay-wise, nearly everything that was in the previous hitman games is in this one as well, though with more features and tweaks that were made in this one. One thing is for sure, is the assassination are still pleasurable to do and executing them in a variety of ways. Though not as much as the previous game, it still has enough to be considerable as replay value. Some of the added tweaks is the storing of multiple bodies in containers and also hiding there with them to avoid enemies. Others such as more stealth sequences and gunplay have been improved from the previous games and are much more fluid than before. The biggest downside is the disguise system. The series has often prided themselves for using disguises as a means to sneaking past the enemy and getting the end target. The developers have tacked on one of the worst features destroy another key element of the game. If using a disguise of an occupation in the area. The NPC's will detect you in a second flat. This hinders the game so much that it makes it incredibly hard, especially on more difficult missions. Though playing on easier levels will give you an instinct mode which will allow you move pass your enemies without them detecting you. Though this is problematic as well cause it always runs out too quickly and if in a situation needing to get out of and your meter is empty, good luck getting a perfect score. It's another redundant and flawed aspect to the game. Last but not least the score meter has been changed too, compared to Hitman Blood Money which gave you a list of result on how you executed you mission (I won't go into anymore detail than this), instead here it's nothing more than a score meter in which killing enemies, not hiding their bodies or any sort of lethal forces minus' points of your score. Not only is this annoying, but it limits how you want to play the game properly. \r\n\r\nGraphically the game is very good looking, with much variety in the locations you're in, the detail and the texture design all are wonderful. Audio is excellent as well. Story characters are much different to the previous games, your enemies are more gross and bizarre in their own little way, with much more character behind who they are.

For one thing they are both able to establish themselves in a time period that is realistic and truthful to it. In this one, you're immersed in its culture and lingo of the 40's to 50's. It seems that 2K Czech have done above beyond job to provide a beautiful city established in two different seasons in different times. They provide a game that doesn't betray the period. As you continue into the game you'll see the development from everything from cars, buildings to clothing. The game is never anachronistic to its setting. Such development is one which I appreciate the most about Mafia II compared to the original game.\r\n\r\nMafia II's story is decent though not quite as dramatic or emotionally attaching as the original and even to other gangster genre games. The main characters and their personalities are diverse though and with many characters to meet which provide cut-scenes with great moments. Mafia II's great weakness is its lack of focus on how it uses its story in the world. By this I mean the interaction in the world except specific place makes the open-world element of the game feel barren and redundant. It seems around 50-70% of the mission are designated in location which were specifically designed for the mission themselves. It doesn't help much as the world it immerses you in is quite amazing. In the previous game, though that can be similar parallels to this issue, Mafia I still provides a Free Roam mode and does use up more of its locations in the city. Mafia II provides no more replay value to its original. The game's world feels wasted. \r\n\r\nII's gameplay though during mission is quite excellent, the gunplay is smooth and slick, similar to that of GTA IV's gunplay.

Mafia is set in a era that is unexpected to the gaming world, the old-time feel the era of the 1930's. The game starts from the early 1930's near to the 40's, though the game shows an astounding amount of change, in its detail of the world and how the culture shifts from one to another. This is one of the dedicated parts to the games production. The developers show that they care more about the story and the setting it's located in. The change of time after each mission will unlock a certain area that wasn't restricted before, the areas will all have different music to them, in which it helps provide an accurate look and feel of the place. The music is the classic songs of the era. Most notably the song 'The Mooch' by the famed Jazz musician Duke Ellington. Indeed Mafia's care with the setting also shows how much the story and characters are developed in this game. Mafia's story is one of rags to riches and how all violence leads to many consequences. Though being a standard overview of the entire game, the detail of each mission and aspects of dialogue and storytelling is wholly unique. The game provides a world for you to look and see, without limiting it to certain locations. Though mostly the game will provide a ton of unique location specific for that mission, the game's world can feel sometimes being wasted away. But not as much. \r\nThe environment and changing of years relates to the setting very well. The game provides many location where your jobs or missions have unique interaction with the environment.

It only lies shy on the core story.", "updated_at": 1447359756514, "positive_points": "Soundtrack\r\nArtwork\r\nLeaves an everlasting effect", "content": "Eyecandy: Supergiant Games definitely have an eye for art. Each level/area, is something to behold. It has inspiring landscapes and dream-like sunsets. The texture pallet didn't seem repetitive and every nook and cranny is filled with the utmost detail and the still frame cinematics manage to push forward the story rather than hold it back. And it's all by hand too. I honestly wish I knew more about art, but if I had to try and pin it, I would say somewhere around the pastel look is how this game is. The game's artist \"JenZee\" actually has a Deviantart page where you can view all of his work.\r\n\r\nSoundDesign: The actual effects in Transistor were very nicely designed and have a good variety with each enemy and each attack. They all sounded of high quality and were believable. Although, there were moments where I was spamming a certain attack and it was the same sound effect every time and it did annoy me. But that's just a personal peeve. The voice acting was also a work of art. Logan Cunningham, who is coming back to Supergiant from doing Bastion, brought Transistor to life. He had a very smooth performance and it never sounded like he was \"nagging\". But, the music, Oh Lord let's talk about this music. Darren Korb is now in my top 10 composers. Once again, he flawlessly executed a video game. If you're familiar with his other works you'll recognize his eclectic influences all nicely wrapped into multiple tracks. If I had to guess a genre it would be something crazy insane like Digital-folk-hiphop or something. I don't know, but it's all there, guitars, the beats, harps, accordions, synths, a little bit of everything. After buying the soundtrack (as I did with Bastion) it's been on repeat all day. And if you liked Ashley Lynn Barrett in Bastion, then you'll love her in Transistor. Darren snatched her right back into the studio and made yet another masterpiece. The overall mood of the OST is depressing, moody, dark, but  uplifting at the same time. And because there's a music filter within the game I caught myself pausing, unpausing, and Turn()ing within the game just so I could hear all the different versions of one track seamlessly transition into one another. A definite recommendation.\r\n\r\nGameplay: Transistor kind of has you on that off-angle-top-down-view (called Isometric). It features real time combat with a strategy based feature called Turn(). When you press the command, the battlefield freezes and you can plan out your attack according to however you see fit, and then when you hit the command again, Red goes off and executes all the moves and combos at light speed, and then you wait for it to recharge, it's really cool and at times can even save your life. Now when I played this game I only died I believe, twice. But TECHNICALLY I probably died about 99kajillion times. The way death works in this game is that you have four slots for attacks called Functions. Each function has two upgrade slots that you use your other acquired functions for certain buffs. As well you can apply a Passive Upgrade to your character, for a constant battlefield effect. Now when you run out of health, you lose your functions one by one. Then when you run out of health on your last function, it's game over. Supergiant is very forgiving in this game and they don't want you to die, they give every chance possible. At very few times did I feel cheated and only yelled out \"Bullspit!\" one time. But even then, one of the buildings got in the way of the borders of the battlefield. Usually when something like that happens the engine will \"hollow out\" the structure so that you can see the main character at all times. Well this game did not do that and actually caused me a death. But if you happen to be dying too much you can hit your own little personal beach house called the Sandbox and practice different moves, combos, etc. There's doorways that lead to speed, resistance, and other challenges alike to hone your skills. And upon each mission that's completed, you unlock a piece of the soundtrack to listen to AND get granted experience so you can stay ahead of the games rising difficulty. I spent so much time there, that at one point, I did forget where I was and upon returning to Cloudbank, Transistor said, \"Back to reality...\". If the game is too easy, you can activate what's called a Limiter to debuff the main character somehow, but the trade-off is it will give you an extra percentage on top of what you earned for every battle you win. So in a way, you choose the difficulty of the game at any time. Also when you beat it, there's a Recursion mode where you keep everything from your last playthrough and go at it again.

Red (who used to be a renown singer/artist) and Transistor (whose origin is unknown) are on a journey to get Red's voice and Transistor's body back after an orginization called the Camerata invented a robot army called the Process and basically committed a genocide on a city named Cloudbank. It starts you off in a cutscene, where the two meet each other, but somehow know each other, and then it immediately goes. Searching the city will reveal terminals where Red can communicate with Transistor and as you explore, Transistor is always talking (which never got bothersome) furthering the narrative filling in little tidbits here and there.

", "updated_at": 1431236281375, "positive_points": "- Killing Zombies is satisfying\r\n- Many weapons and variety.\r\n- Quite a lengthy game with many quests.", "content": "Dead Island is somewhat of a flawed gem. It's by no means a bad game, but its flaws make it impossible to consider it to be ever a solid game. Dead Island for the most part, is one of many zombie horror games out there. It dumps you into a sandbox world on an island in which the undead have sprung up and started to kill innocent people. Locations of nice tropical springs, the dirty slums of the islands' city and to the swampy jungles. In summary it has all the locations for you to fight zombies in and to tackle the environment at the same time. \r\n\r\nNow when playing the game the first thing that is very much noticeable is the fact that the graphical style of the game conflict with the actual themes that they're trying to present. Character animations and facial designs look goofy at best, with either eyes bulging out hilariously or a bleak and stiff looking faces that have no emotions to them. Sam B has to be my favourite character only because he has the goofy animations, voice acting and silly expressions on his face in every cutscene. Other graphical problems that were a bother, was the outdated feel of the game (not bad just outdated). Much of the textures look very much blotchy and low-resolution with the anti-aliasing covering it up in the worse possible way, making it look like someone had smeared vaseline all over the textures. This lessens the atmosphere greatly and doesn't feel like a serious game with serious themes. \r\nFrom a story standpoint the game tries to make it seem like it's a very serious game, with character talking about what horrible things have happened. Dialogue and cutscenes that were meant to be emotional though fall flat. Overall there's nothing special about it. The story was more of a turnoff and a cliche than anything else.\r\n\r\nThe meat of the game is the gameplay, choosing from one of four character with their own special abilities and skills provide more replay value to the game. The gameplay has this semi-realistic aspect to it. Every time you swing your weapon it will use some of your stamina up but also may hurt your opponent by braking it limbs. This makes every fight when encountering zombies to use your stamina wisely. Consider that, zombies in the game are not just slow walking zombies but various in their abilities. Some are generic walkers, but others are runners (infected), strong zombies (thugs) and much more. Though this does spice the gameplay up a lot, the way that the game throws them at you can be a problem. \r\nDying in the game can be very quick due to how many come at you. The infected are possibly the most annoying of the bunch and had led me to many deaths that are often unfair. Another problem can be the fact that your hits could be totally on target with any of their body parts but completely miss them, not taking any damage. I found moments where I was infuriated due to these problems. Other problems is how it paces some gameplay modes. If you play the character that specialises in armed weapons then over a quarter of the game (which is about 5 hours in) have you not using or finding a gun. There're problems all across the board for this game but somehow fighting zombies and landing perfect hits are very much satisfying. Pretty much this is one of the saving points of the game. \r\n\r\nAnother pro, would be the weapons system, which has a variety of classes, types and modification which make it much more enjoyable to use. Lately it is quite a long game, it doesn't just provide you with a main story but also many side missions which can help level-up, most of them being quite enjoyable.\r\n", "likes": 0, "slug": "serious-themes-goofy-experience", "introduction": "Techland had made a bit of a splash when producing a very slick and emotionally charged CGI trailer that would have several mature themes feature their zombie horror game Dead Island.

I do also have to say this companion is important to the plot not just some tag along. She has this physic powers that allows her to open \"tears\" which are basically mini time reverse areas in the map and It's confusing story wise but it'll help you alot throughout the game, bet.

When I came to the Internet-gaming shop close to school, I saw every one is playing it. Quickly dig in and enjoy the game, great co-op, great voice acting, good special zombies (Boomer, hunter, tank...), smart map, well story. I started from there. In high school, 2009, me and my buddies even created a team to go around in the city to challenge or play with other gamers and group. Although this game is not a big hit in my place, still it has many many players when it first released. So this game is not only a game for, it also a memory of our friendship and hours of non stop action, both versus and co-op. \r\n\r\n+ Experience:\r\n\r\nPro: \r\n- Graphic: Great, amazing, all the zombies, maps, special infected, characters was well made. All those bloody action, the thrill of being pulled or grabbed by Hunter, Smoker or Jockey was awesome. Source Engine creates an amazing atmosphere for L4D and even better for L4D2. Cloudy sky, foggy city, dim tunnel, dark and scary sewage..... \r\n\r\n- Characters: The best thing I think is each character can express their feeling in different situation, such as laughing, seeing a theme park, see Mid night rider, or even get ride by a Jockey, their scream and face expression is amazing. \r\n\r\n- Sound: Very well done, all the music and sound when a horde is approaching, tank coming, special infected closing down, I feel like my body going through an adrenalin rush. Voice acting is also a huge plus. \r\n\r\n- Game play: Good campaign, Great Co-op, Amazing Versus. When L4D first released, only Co-op was available at that time. When they updated the versus mode, and L4D2 was released, the sh*t just hit the fan. I enjoy it so much. Weapon arsenal is well done, although there is not likes hundred of choices, but every gamers can choose a weapon fit their play style: Shotgun for close combat, Sniper Rifle for range, DMR for quick sniper ,assault rifle for all purpose. Then in L4D2 melee weapons join the game. Although they are melee, each of them have different characteristic, such as katana has long range and swing very fast, machete is fast and deadly, baseball bat and cricket bat although slower but crush the enemies. Sometime, special weapon shows up such as M60, chain saw, grenade launcher, foam hand give a special twist to the game too. Along with a right amount of med kit, pills, special ammo, explosives scattering around every map, the players feel like they are well supported in L4D2. \r\n\r\n- Special infected: The originals were good, the seconds were even better. And also with the common special infected such as \"the guy in the fire suit\", \"the guy in police suit\", \"the mud man\", \"the clown\". \r\n\r\n- Console command: Easy to learn\r\n\r\n- Modding: *Modding intensifies*\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n\r\nThe only cons I have is the online server, in Oceania or Asia, there are hardly 4,5 servers which have ping below 100 and they are all occupied most of the time. Sometime I find myself forced to leave the game because just could not find a good multiplayer server to play. And the server browser search and filter is also very limited. Even if we don't want to play some dumb mode, it shows up and it takes time to get in game and get out. It needs a better filter. \r\n\r\n+ Conclusion: Amazing game for zombie genre lover. I give it a 9 out of 10. Everything in this game is almost perfect and the modding community makes it even better. With extra maps, campaign, weapons skin, the game can be play for a long time.  \r\n", "likes": 0, "slug": "best-zombie-fps-ever", "introduction": "Since the very first day of the first Left 4 Dead in 2008 until now, I believe that I have around 1000+ hour in-game.

You'll constantly be fighting against the current if you try to bumrush through everything. In the beginning, it creates and introduces everything with little tutorials to help you through the first couple hours because there is a learning curve to this game. I was personally wondering how the events of the second game would effect the third and it sits you down, while getting a haircut and shave (that grows back in real time), and you actually set the game up yourself. If you didn't play the second Witcher it's ok, just pick the options that most appeals to you, but for me, I picked all of the things that I did in the second and now I have to go back and play again with different options because there are HUGE chunks of game I know I'm missing out on. Projekt Red does is right. A character doesn't just make a little cameo, you fight, talk, plunder, drink, and sometimes even make it to the bed with certain characters (I actually lost count of all the women I slept with). But much more importantly it sets a new standard for interactivity and choice , where even seemingly minor choices that you make in a side quest ends up coming back to affect the main story hours later. Every game developer should be studying the quests of the Witcher 3, particularly the side quests and how they are deep, meaningful, and way more interesting than most game's Main Storylines. We often hear developers say how \"the players choices will affect the game world\", but this is the second time that I have ever felt that to be genuinely true, aside from the second Witcher. It completely blows the simplistic Bethesda and Bioware approach out of the water in this respect. And even when you think you're making a good decision all sorts of unforeseen consequences end up happening in the world, with even entire villages going barren because of a \"good\" decision you made, or re-inhabiting a town because you eradicated the bandits that raided it. It is genuinely the greatest quest and choice outcome system ever made, by miles. Going back to playing the quests of Fallout, Mass Effect, any Elder Scrolls game after this is a MASSIVE step back. I honestly want to just go in and talk about every little detail about this game and how phenomenal my experience was but that would take too long. This game is honestly a staple and a standard. This game is The Ocarina of Time of the new consoles. Nothing is skimped out on, and everything has the utmost attention to detail. The world also feels like a real place, everything as if its handcrafted, instead of the generic copy-paste that plagues today's game worlds.  There were points in the game where I was attending concerts, acting in plays, fistfighting a bear in a fight club, sailing the seas and diving for sunken treasure, betting on horse races, and kicking ass at card tournaments. There is nothing this game doesn't have. It is all there. Even the character's voice acting and expression is incredible, the facial expressions are up there with LA Noire. You genuinely end up watching the highly detailed NPC faces to try and figure out their intentions. And there is rarely a good vs. bad narrative, its almost always gray and morally unclear. You'll end up pondering your decisions days after you step away from the screen, and the dark world doesn't shy away from some very uncomfortable topics, it treats you like an adult. It will renew your faith in an increasingly troubled industry, and fill even the most jaded gamer with a sense of wonder of how a game this big, complex, and well made is even possible. After my 100+ hours of just ONE playthrough, there was only a couple things I nitpicked on. When riding your mount (whenever it wasn't pissing you off) and following/conversing on horseback, the characters, instead of yelling at each other because you have the distance and ambient sounds all around you (like in Red Dead Redemption), they spoke calmly to one another as if they were sitting at the fireplace. The sailing is nothing like Assassin's Creed sailing, instead it's geared more like driving. And the bugs. Oh Lord, the countless bugs. This game definitely needed it's own can of Raid, or Orkin, or something because it was bad. It wasn't New Vegas bad, or Skyrim on PS3 bad, but there was one time where I ran into an infinite loading screen and had to restart the game. That was the worst one.

It seemed like Avalanche Studios was trying to find a balance between their style of gaming (Just Cause) and Warner Brothers formula for games, and they ALMOST had it. A lot doesn't make sense within this game, and if I was to recommend an open world RPG in this respect, I would recommend Shadow of Mordor.", "updated_at": 1444844496164, "positive_points": "Beautiful Landscape\r\nDecent Characters and Voice Acting", "content": "EYECANDY: The landscape in Mad Max is wonderful. A beautifully crafted wasteland that feels vast and empty. The particle effects (smoke, dust, fire, etc.) are nothing short of professional and was probably the best looking part of the game. Each enemy camp, cave, blown up gas station, underground cavern are all unique and you won't notice any repeating interiors. A lot of crafting and detail went into the areas of exploration and it shows. This is easily the best part of the game, the visuals.\r\n\r\nSOUNDDESIGN: Sad to say though there's nothing too special too denote here. The explosions are really the only thing that is hi-fi in this game, or as far as sound goes, stood out and somewhat made you feel it. The soundtrack was a sub-par score. No melodies that get stuck in your head, no catchy tunes to hum along to, just background noise. But I'll give the voice actors some credit. While you meet wildly different characters, none of them stand out. I think it's because they're all far too left field. Each main character is quirky and crazy in their own right, but in a way caused them all to blend together. But what was really cool was when during the most important cutscenes in the game the audio didn't match up with the video. Not like it mattered because the SFX sucked anyways, but that's just another tick that takes away from the experience.\r\n\r\nGAMEPLAY: Now in this game, there is a lot to do. The wasteland is very big, which is also its drawback. It's too big, and going from one place to another, collecting scrap for your upgrades, and destroying enemy camps to lower the threat level in allied territory feels more like a chore. Kind of like when your parents would tell you to clean your room. It wasn't fun and you only did it because you had to. There is a lot of mechanics to be had in this game though. Mad Max is all about the cars, and in this game, there are a multiple of cars you can collect, fight, customize, everything. But what I don't get is why in the world would you have the main mechanic in your game be broken and wonky as hell. The driving in Mad Max is atrocious. From the seizure-like camera to the street mechanics themselves. You will find yourself constantly doing flips and turns and making bad turns and sharp corners, running into walls and off cliffs and pretty much anything else that constitutes bad driving (refer to the hallway car scene in the first Austin Powers). There was more than one mission that was all vehicle based (not counting the race side missions) and I wanted to quit the game. I say it all the time: There is a very big difference between challenging, and frustrating, and the driving in Mad Max is VERY frustrating. Then there's the leveling system. You level up Max to earn new abilities, gear, skills, etc. But then there's some weird prophet guy that reminds me of the happy mask salesman from Majoras Mask where you can level up Max again. So it's like you level up Max to level him up again. It's a strange concept. And the fighting is only fun when it works. I know I wasn't the only one because I brought it up with other people and they said they had the same problems but throughout the whole entire game the engine refuses to read your input and you will die because of unfair mechanics. Warner Brothers has their game formula. A big map with multiple vantage points, and you do stuff within said area.", "likes": 2, "slug": "mad-max-written-review", "introduction": "Mad Max holds a minimalist type story. I'll give it to you in one sentence. Max has a past he's trying to \"escape\" from, and he needs to build a car with a V8 engine to cross the Plains of Silence. Which is unexplained (or at least it wasn't made clear to me why he wanted to do that) and the only way to do that is with his faithful companion named Chumbucket who is a mechanical prodigy and wears a spark plug necklace, looks like the hunchback from 300, pesters you like the fairies in Zelda, and talks like Smeagol. The game then attempts to fill in the world and backstory a little bit by collecting what is called History Relics and they're just pictures with captions 'The Last of Us' style and Max gives a little line of dialogue with each one that's found but there's barely any motivation or interest to collect them or find out the history so it feels like filler. But I will say that I thought Max was an awesome character. He's that cold-hearted and ruthless type that cares about nobody but himself which mixed things up from the casual hero type but did lead to some confusion at the end of the story which was horrible and anti-climactic.

There were no texture loading issues, lo-res sections of the map, and care and detail went into all of the environments and models. Halo takes you to different worlds throughout the galaxy and they all feel organic, refreshing, and genuine. All artifacts and landscapes have their own history, fauna, civilization, and at some points was even amazed. This game has moments where you want to stop and take in the scenery and search around the level (because if you know Halo then you know about the skulls and intel). I was truly impressed with what 343 came up with. Once again, only two complaints: One, which is pretty minor, there were sections of the game with water and when you crouch beneath it there's no water effects, the game just becomes clear instead of murky, or blue, or whatever, but it doesn't actually take away from the game. Two, the animations of characters in the distance end up coming off really choppy. At first I thought it was the framerate, but then realized it was how the engine handles in-game events. It looks weird and takes away from the fluidity of the game. But other than those, this game is B-E-A-UTIFUL.\r\n\r\nSOUNDDESIGN - This is easily one of the best part of Halo. As far as sound design goes, I put it right up there with Battlefield and The Witcher. At first I had it coming through my TV speakers and it sounded fine. Nothing great, but not lacking. Then I put on my Astro headset, changed the sound option to 'headphones', and it elevated the game to a whole new level. Each team member's footsteps are differentiating, you can hear the individual breathing of the character's and covenant when you get close, the list goes on. The effects are high quality, all weapons sound realistic and authentic (even the fictionalized ones), and it never blended all together as one muddy \"blah\" in the background when the game or cutscenes got really intense *coughcough*CallofDuty*coughcough* but actually became more immersive the louder I turned the volume up. And the soundtrack is top notch and mixed excellently with all the chaos, yelling, and explosions. The game has three-dimensional sound and you can tell who's far off, who's next to you, what weapons the enemy is using, everything. The main menu's title theme holds plenty of texture and sounds are full and satisfying with a hint of nostalgia, while the battle music amps up every conflict and makes all firefights intense. This is a soundtrack I will purchase. I just wish during the quiet and ambient parts of the game there was a little more melody to give the worlds and environment just a little bit more culture, but honestly that's just a personal preference of mine. Not one complaint in this department. Everything is absolutely perfect. \r\n\r\nGAMEPLAY - As far as a FPS goes, there's not much to talk about. The story was on the shorter side, BUT there were parts that were straight pissing me off. I played through the campaign on Heroic (hard) difficulty because the game said that for Halo veterans, this difficulty is the best one. So I chose it and launched myself in. Halo puts you through the game with squad members, four in total including yourself. And it ain't no Ghost Recon or anything, but you can \"command\" your squad to go places, focus on enemies, or pick you up when you fall down. But let's take a moment to talk about this AI real quick. Something that Halo as a franchise has always put emphasis on. They utilize the \"feature\" horribly. Your teammates are awful companions and are 'too smart' for their own good which ends up hurting you in the end. What I noticed 343 tried to do was to make your squad tactical, but it leads to a lot of frustration. When the team is told to focus on a certain enemy, only one will focus on said enemy and the guy even told me, and I quote, \"As soon as I kill this soldier, I'll get to him\". Um, no, I'm your commander, I'm your leader, and you do as I say. If I tell you to focus on this enemy because I need some cover fire, then you put your attention on that enemy. If I need suppression so I can flank this turret, then that's what you do. If this were real life, that would be completely understandable. But it's not. And they put in a new feature where instead of dying, you have about 15-20 seconds for a member of your squad to make it you and pick you back up before you actually die. It's so you can get a second chance (you can be dropped infinite times) and keep the momentum and the fight going. BUT a lot of this game was spent waiting for my team and reloading from the last checkpoint because my teammates barely ever revived me. Never mind the countless times I picked them up, they would either be a couple tens of yards away (all three of them) for whatever reason, or they would stand about four feet away from me and watch me bleed out. Just stand there and watch me die. And of course there's no suicide option so you HAVE to wait for them to get you. And the driving, oh Lord the driving, is the worst part of their brain. I sat on the back of a mongoose for a solid half minute while my partner just chose to not drive anywhere. But it's a good thing they didn't because when they did drive somewhere they were too busy flipping over and running into walls \"Austin Power-ing\" themselves while we get shot at and blown up. This is the worst team AI in the Halo series and it was a serious step backwards. But enough about that. The actual missions themselves vary in length and hold a lot of nice variety to keep the game fresh and interesting. Halo has been an open world-esque type of shooter and it plays in nicely and is definitely a good change of pace than the usual go-here-shoot-follow-this-npc formula. The stupidest, and shortest, mission though is when you're at a friendly camp and you have to eavesdrop on people. It was very strange and horribly executed. Other than that, Every gun has a zoom type option, when you jump and aim in mid air, the spartan actually stabilizes himself for a couple seconds so you float and can pull off a couple headshots, but the side to side sway is really slow and can't be edited in the options menu even when the sensitivity is set to a higher amount. I've died from the simple fact that I couldn't turn to shoot the enemy. I couldn't figure out why it played like that, but it did.\r\n\r\nMULTIPLAYER - Arguably the only reason why Halo ever got to be so popular was because of it's competitive aspect. The company took a little bit of a different take on it and split it into two sections. Arena and Warzone. Arena is the traditional 4v4 Slayer, Swat, the classic halo multiplayer. Warzone is a big team battle where it melds a lot of what other games did. First off, the type I found the most fun was its Warzone mode where it was team against team, with AI enemies included. It consisted of a Battlefront/field type where you take control of certain command points, and at the end destroy the enemie's home base all while killing the Prometheans and Covenant for extra points to win. I experienced very little lag (I think it was me in all honesty) and even when I lost I wanted to keep playing. At the end of each match you gain your experience, and get REQ cards. Their earned when you rank up, or when you buy them. There's three different types of packs, Bronze, Silver, and Gold. Which can be bought with the points that are earned in every game, or with an actual credit card transaction. Within the packs are special weapons, boosts, armor upgrades, etc. What it reminded me of was Mass Effect's special packs, Titanfalls cards, and Advanced Warfare's feature where you earn outfit customizations and experience boosts. Overall it's a whole separate experience from the campaign and it's still a hell of a lot of fun.", "likes": 1, "slug": "halo-5-guardians-written-review", "introduction": "Halo 5 deals with two main characters this time around. Good ol' Master Chief with his Blue Team and John Locke, leader of Team Osiris. And it's pretty good. The campaign itself is pretty short, probably about ten hours, if not less. But there's a lot of quality to be had in this game.

Besides Harmonix is planning to release new updates over time with the first update coming around the corner. One the plan updates is variable breakneck speed which would be nice. So for now if you have working instruments I recommend staying on Rock Band 3 until the game is feature heavy. Otherwise Rock Band 4 is solid update and it’s here to stay.", "updated_at": 1446739792732, "positive_points": "More Rock Band!!\r\nNew and updated instruments.\r\nVan Halen!!!", "content": "With Rock Band 4, Harmonix decided to concentrate on what made Rock Band what it was today. They wanted to go back to what Rock Band was all about. Jamming out to your favorite songs, old and new. At its roots it’s still your basic Rock Band game; notes coming down a highway and hitting them with succession. The biggest feature is the addition of freestyle solos. Instead of individual notes during a solo section, it is replaced by lines that the appear on a certain beat. Here you can press the frets anyway you want. Only thing you are required is to hit the strum bar to pace they set. \r\n\r\nThey also revamped the option to play a set list, instead you pick the initial song and once you finish the song a list of new ones come up and you vote on the next one. Along with the option to drop in and out of songs and change difficulties on the fly, it keeps the party momentum going. The downside this is they removed the option to just pick the whole set list you would like to play from the start.\r\n\r\nTour mode is back but it feels more like a downgrade with the removal of the loading animations. You know, the ones where your band is shown riding a limo or doing a sound check. While you still have the choices after every section of the tour. It feels more like a “Choose your next bonus” instead of feeling like a choose your own adventure. They do however cause little quirks at the end of the tour like having to shave your hair since you contracted lice from a fan’s bird.\r\n\r\nCertain features are not in the game at all like online multiplayer, practice mode, and a robust character creation system. Two of these are really big omissions. Harmonix did however ensured they are listening to the fans and updates are coming. This is what makes Rock Band 4 interesting. It will be the last Rock Band game to be released. Because of this they are going to continue to support RB4 with updates and new features well into the future. Sounds like they want to avoid flooding the market with plastic instruments again.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of which they got rid of Pro Guitar, and the keytar entirely. While this is a huge blow to those that invested in those instruments. According to Harmonix, they surveyed many Rock Band fans and found out many did not really care for those instruments.  Luckily for me they decided to stick with Pro Drums since the support for it has been built in since Rock Band 1. That being said, Harmonix tried to support as many legacy instruments as they could. They included every single wireless rock band instrument including RB1. They also managed to support most Guitar Hero guitars including some early ones, which is a nice bonus. With this you would be able to purchase any of the two standalone versions and continue rocking out. Madcatz did release updated instruments alongside with the game as well. You can tell they put some thought into them to make sure they would last. The pads on the drums feel like a tougher rubber. The neck on guitar feels less “plasticky.” They also included the option to update the firmware just in case some issues do arise.\r\n\r\nThe on disc songs are somewhat lackluster but some big names are here like Bruno Mars’s Uptown Funk and ever popular Panama by Van Halen. This fault is overshadowed by the fact the 1500+ legacy DLC library was updated and ported to the next gen consoles. A feat that sounded impossible, so I give Harmonix a round of applause for that. Another commendable act on their part is that you would be able to re-download every song you have purchased in older versions of Rock Band free of charge for this new game. As for those newcomers to the series, having access to such a robust song library with so many varying styles will please any fan. The price for each song did however increase to $1.99, but this is due in part adding freestyle solos to every song in the library.\r\n\r\n", "likes": 0, "slug": "become-the-rock-legend-you-dream-of-with-rock-band-4", "introduction": "After what felt like an eternity (alongside the fact that my instruments practically broke down from constant usage), being able to play really had me hyped.

Along Corrin’s quest for the truth he comes across several characters. While some are awesome and witty *coughAdamcough*, and others who are just plain dull, Miranda, there’s enough voice acting to go around.  Every single dialog in this game is fully voice but sadly it’s accompanied by stiff moving animations. If only the models moved a little better you would be able to feel the emotions of the characters. With easter eggs sprinkled here and there and an interesting plot twist, which I had to read up on it online to understand it, it makes the story somewhat enjoyable.\r\n\r\nThe world that accompanies this story is probably not the most appeasing. Every corridor in the game looks similar but in a different shade of dark. Makes you wonder if the future really is going to be all about dark colors. Most if not all levels are different combinations of big rooms or small corridors with places to cover. This is where each battle begins to get a tad repetitive. With no real variation in areas, they might as well made the entire game horde mode.  Which brings me into the controls.\r\n\r\nThe last voice controlled game I played was almost 10 years ago. So coming into this game I had high hopes that the tech has advanced far enough to make using it enjoyable. It still has its bugs here and there but it is still usable. Iridium Studios tries to alleviate the ailments by giving you the option to rename almost all of the voice commands. They give you a few default alternatives and some of them are funny like, “Party at Foxtrot 4.” But sometimes the issue is not with the commands. The game won't outright register you if you start to get flustered when the enemies are doing some heavy damage. I ended up having to speak like a caveman to ensure I would keep calm and have the game register me. When its working the game is quite fun to control. Makes me feel like a dictator and the game characters are my peons. It would have been nice to have better keyboard and mouse controls, but in doing so would kind of ruin the story of the game.\r\n\r\nThis games soundtrack is quite enjoyable. With some awesome guitar riffs and synths, the game feels more like future you would find in an 80’s movie.  The soundtrack is composed by Big Giant Circles (Jimmy Kinson) and Ronald Jenkees.

You play as Vinnie Cannoli, an enforcer for a mob boss who desires a man by the name of Frankie that resides in Thugtown, considerably a hostile area. Narration provides us with a sort of semi-mystery to the plot, as the people of Thugtown are becoming zombies for some unknown reason and Vinnie only tasked with bringing back someone to his mob boss gets stuck in the teeth of the undead. \r\n\r\nThe story presented in the game is nothing more than something to drive the gameplay. Detail and depth in this storyline are barely there, with very little interest in pushing anything meaningful, the story is never told in the gameplay and is limited to cutscene which hold not value or depth. This can be considered understandable as the game's whole reasons for its existence is to blow up zombies in the 1920's-era. \r\nThe story aside, the gameplay which is the main focus of the entire game is worthy of merit. The game has you blasting away at zombies non-stop with 1920's guns and a few other weapons that are somewhat science fiction-like but still fit in due to the non-nonsensical nature of the game. Gunplay provides satisfaction as the game provides much of the gore goodness to come out of the both genres, I never would have expected such enjoyment in using a Tommy Gun in disposing my enemies. Though there're some downsides to the gameplay, that is that the featured variation of zombies to be found can be quiet annoying and a unfair disadvantage on the player at some moments of the game. Other enemies (rats for example) found in the game also have similar annoyance due to the size and the amount of time it takes to unload the unnecessary amount of bullet into them to be killed. Though one can consider this a little bit of a nick-pick on my part, these moments I felt were unsatisfactory. \r\n\r\nGraphically speaking the game has some very good looking appeal to it. The hand drawn design of the world and animations have a charm to them that can't be replicated in 3D games. The sense of the 1920's feel is perfectly captured. Audio also has a role to play in this game, though somewhat overlooked in areas (this would include music), the music in the game has the aesthetic appealing to that of the 1920's though over a period of time, it becomes very much a chore to listen to it while playing the game and becomes sort of uneven with dramatic moment in the game. Other elements of the audio production though were reasonably good. The voice actor have that cliché gangster tone or the sort of New York accent, all of which were good fun hearing during game.  \r\n\r\nLastly, I have to mention was the game was unfortunately unnecessarily short which did disappoint me, clocking around 3 hours to finish it normal with multiple deaths on occasion.

The first ever game played by this reviewer was Half-life and that works brilliantly in 3D as does the rest of the franchise. For future reference the system being used is NVidia nVision. up until recently it was necessary to use glasses and a separate receiver but now you can purchase a monitor that is equipped with 120 Hz refresh rate and built-in 3D receiver. The advantage of the newer screen is that the entire game plays in almost perfect light. You see -  because 3D shutter glasses tend to shut the light out on every second frame your view is usually quite dark but the new system seems to have fixed that problem.\r\nFar Cry 4 works well in 3D but not perfectly. In earlier 3D shooters your gun would actually extend out from the screen to your keyboard depending on how high you have convergence set. For some reason the stock of your gun in FC4 now bends back into the screen - So in actual fact its not a real 3D gun but all else is relatively good. Don't expect full deep 3D vision but more of a 3D feel which is far better than standard 2D.  For those who are real keen on getting a game working well in 3D try doing a web search for Helix mod 3d.

They have some out-of-character moments, but you'll feel pitty of the good guys and want to kill the assholes as soon as the option pops out.\r\nIt is really long, as well. For this kind of games, that is (arround 10 hours beating the main story).\r\nThe situations that will present in front of you are the point-and-click type.

That's classic point-and-click stuff afterall. Good references.\r\n\r\nThis game has all the ingredients to be a masterpiece.

In fact, I appreciate that.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut I can't pass a game that tells me \"all your decisions will affect the story\" and does EVERYTHING IT CAN to ignore your decisions. No matter how decesive a decision looks: by the next episode (or sooner), you'll see that had no relevance to the plot. And if it did, it will be nullfilled very soon.\r\nAnd this dulls the game. It dulls the game, because the story you'll read is basically the same no matter what you do. They dull the characters the game puts so much effort to build up, because they will do certain scripted things, no matter if you befriended them or treat them horrible. Sometimes they will act different... but that's because this decision is not crucial to advance the plot. To advance it to the ending the creators had in mind. A good one, but the only one.\r\n\r\nThat's why I had to quit it so much points. It's not that the story or the ending is bad. They are good.

I beat the game on Survivor mode, it's hardest difficulty, and still finished it in about 9/10 hours with an almost 80% completion. The last fight was a little cliched and anti-climactic, but the very last cinematic made up for it. The game didn't end on a cliffhanger, but there will definitely be another one.

", "updated_at": 1453257582319, "positive_points": "Driven and exciting story\r\nVoice actors\r\nVisuals", "content": "EyeCandy: The visuals of this newest Tomb Raider are great. The environment and texture artists really outdid themselves in this installment driving home an authentic feel of wherever the journey takes you. A lot of time, detail, and professionalism went into the world of Lara's adventure and it shows. I myself have never been to Russian prisons, mass grave sites and torture chambers, or Byzantine tombs,  but if I ever do end up in one of those bizarre places I would imagine it would look exactly like this game. Even the areas that weren't completely void of life were warm and rich with creatures and fauna. It doesn't matter where you traverse in this universe, whether it be crawling through glaciers, sidling on cliffs in a cave, or solving ancient puzzles in hidden tombs. This world is real.\r\n\r\nSoundDesign: I was pleasantly pleased at the audio engineering and even a little surprised. The sounds are Hi-Fi, custom and believable, and the ambiance is incredible and really elevates you to the game's peak by its excellent job of immersion. The soundtrack holds originality and has a few memorable tracks you'll be hoping to hear every now again. To me it wasn't a boring blend of instruments and themes already explored and are found in standard AAA video games and movies. The actor's performances are all incredible and I even got attached to a man that was never revealed in the game. I caught myself searching for a non existent character's diary entries, essentially, for the simple fact that it was very progressive, and the voice actor was an incredible narrator. Which leads me into the game's dialogue. While it doesn't sit near the writing of The Witcher, every character has their own tone, emotions, and every interaction is unique. If the devs can hear me, keep at this level right here. You have it right.\r\n\r\nGameplay: Rise of the Tomb Raider takes on its new traditional formula of gameplay and added a hell of a lot to it. The game kept its fire camps to upgrade your weapons, spend skill points, and fast travel to other unlocked base camps in the game while Lara chats up little summaries and thoughts of recent events. While I upgraded and added more skills to her repertoire I couldn't help but notice a couple things. Some of the skills are recycled from the first one (makes sense) and some skills are completely useless. Some skills do stack on top of others and add to the base skill which is nice, but there wasn't much improved or added in this department. Just an observation. Over in the weapons section is also the same from the previous title. There's the bow, the pickaxe, and your selection of different variants of a pistol, rifle, and shotgun giving Lara an arsenal of up to four weapons in total giving her an advantage in any situation and the developers being able to adhere to any play style. For example, if like me, you're the type for a heavy offense, I would recommend the Compound Bow, Automatic Shotgun, Heavy Pistol, and the SMG. You'll already have one type of each at your disposal, but it's up to you to explore and find all the pieces you can to build said 'special' weapons. But then this game goes deeper with its crafting system. For each weapon, there's alternate ammo types. The arrows can be armed with a grenade, lit on fire, or sabotaged with a poison (which is my personal favorite) or maybe you want some dragonfire rounds for your shotgun? The option is there. But to get these ammo types you must loot and scrounge to find the basic items: cloth, wood, metal nuts and springs, animal pelts, and so on. This is either a highlight or the nadir of the craft system because it can get overwhelming. Your weapons and gadgets can have attachments, your skills can have skills, it's honestly a little bit of a spider web's mess. Everything seems intertwined, and for the first time in a very long time, I actually didn't disable the pop-up tutorials just because this game is jam packed with all sorts of little features that aren't utilized the entire game. Not a real problem though unlike the games controls and direction. Lara was definitely a tad clunky in certain spots. All game, she is constantly leaping platforms like Nathan Drake, climbing cliffs and mountain sides like one of Desmond's ancestors, and killing and shooting like a madman. Woman, sorry. The environment climbing will send you plummeting into pits of doom because of wrongly registered input controls and the combat mechanics are very dry heavily relying on shallow gunplay. The reason why both of those are problems are because it leads to unnecessary checkpoint reloading, which isn't gamebreaking because Crystal Dynamics are very forgiving with their checkpoints. No, really, the game autosaves every couple minutes and I never once dreaded reloading a checkpoint in fear of having to start over from \"who knows where\" so that almost makes up for it. But the gun combat, while slightly non-redundant, slightly doesn't make sense. Example, your given the choice to upgrade any weapon of your choosing by utilizing the crafting system I briefly described earlier, and while it's very possible to upgrade a weapon's damage, rate of fire, and reload speed, an option is also a gun's recoil stability. Not accuracy, recoil stability. That means no matter how many junk parts you throw into your jerry-rigged AK47, or how true your aim is in a firefight, the weapon will never shoot where it is aimed. I would've lost count if I tried to keep track of how many heads I missed just because the bullet would travel outside of the on-screen reticle. Those two aspects of the game were the most frustrating in my experience. Lara, seemingly intentional, jumping to her death, and a useless gun attribute. Can't hit a single enemy at point blank because of the bullet spread, but at least the gun won't travel upwards.", "likes": 1, "slug": "rise-of-the-tomb-raider-written-review", "introduction": "Rise of the Tomb Raider stars the infamous Lara Croft in her second 'prequel' game while she's still growing up, essentially.

There's new armor, weapons, an introduction to a whole new mechanic called Runes, a whole new culture and populous, and most importantly, more Gwent. More is to be said about the new addition, but that's the gist of it. It's still the same game but is an expansion overall, only helping and adding to the vanilla experience.\r\n\r\nIt starts wherever you personally last left off. Once you start the quest though it throws you right into the mix of things and not even 20 minutes in you're already meeting new characters, fighting difficult monsters, and crawling through sewers. But that momentum comes to a full stop because the first boss is insanely difficult. Like, I'm talking Demon Souls difficult. First off, The Witcher in general isn't a fast paced game. So you can't hack and slash your way through like you would Dragon Age. Granted I was playing on the highest difficulty, but when I finally beat the Toad Prince I wasn't satisfied, nor did I get a sense of achievement and accomplishment. It was more like, \"Fucking FINALLY!\". I even went on the internet because I completely thought I was doing something wrong. Come to find out, I wasn't, the boss is just hard as fuck. Then if that fight wasn't enough, CDPR throws you right into another one but this time the odds are stacked against your favor and this fight is almost as difficult as the first one. Thankfully, this guy is a little weaker. It's the surrounding elements that make it difficult.\r\n\r\nBut that's the only complaint. The crazy difficulty spike. I will say it's almost a perfect intro into what you're about to embark upon. The game revolves mainly around three characters. Geralt the neutral protagonist, Olgierd von Everec the bandit captain, and the Merchant of Mirrors. Without revealing too much, Geralt is tasked with keeping three promises and to stick to his word, Geralt must put himself through the strangest trials he's ever gone through.\r\n\r\nHearts of Stone will take you on a rollercoaster ride. Emotionally, gameplay wise, mentally, it hits you where you feel it most. From being in a circus, to attending a wedding and partaking in all of the party favors. From participating in an auction, to planning a heist Grand Theft Auto style (yes, and you get to personally choose who to recruit) and then entering in a lifeless void of a world simply created by someone's painting.\r\n\r\nAnd no matter how peculiar or out-of-this-world the Witcher gets, it feels so natural because the writing brings it all together perfectly. Hearts of Stone will constantly conflict you and your motives constantly keeping you guessing and speculating the motives of each character. Every line of dialogue is still as precise and specific as ever in delivering the perfect string of words or phrases to perfectly convey the heavy emotion that this game plays at you. It is not for the faint of heart.\r\n\r\nBut the expansion isn't all somber. Old flames (if you've read the books) return and this new love interest actually ended up being my favorite. Triss still wins all, but this new woman was definitely a close runner-up. She's like the light in a darkened world. And fret not, The DLC is still as mature and adult as ever still bringing to you the 18+ themes that aren't meant for children. So, yes, sex and titties.\r\n\r\nFor (at this time) 20 US Dollars, Hearts of Stone is easily obtainable. I forgot to mention that the DLC is only half that though. I bought the full edition that came with two complete and perfectly detailed physical Gwent decks. So really, this can be picked up for ten bucks. Some people spend 60 bucks for an incomplete game, a day one patch, and microtransactions.

The music serves to offer a distinct mood to the gameplay and the sound design is clear and expressive, but the audio presentation is bland and lacks any notable features.\r\n\r\nThe game's greatest strength is the level design.

This simple mechanic is used in a wide variety of settings, where sharp timing and a well-thought strategy will always lead the player to success. The game can feel very difficult at times, as the layout of the level is limited to the Gameboy Advance's resolution, forcing the player to mentally visualize various switches and enemy patterns before jumping into action.

But now the last of those elements, the challenging gameplay, can be adjusted in Capcom's second bite at the apple, Mega Man 10. This game introduces \"Easy Mode,\" a typical choice in most video games, but one that the long-running Mega Man series has actually never seen before. With most other features remaining very similar to 9, the most important consideration here is whether you think Easy Mode adds to the game, or perhaps hinders it.\r\n\r\nEasy Mode makes hits to your character less damaging, hits to enemies more damaging, takes out some enemies here and there, and, perhaps most helpfully, puts new platforms down to prevent most falling deaths. These changes make a giant difference, and at least guarantee that you'll live to see the end of the game this time with only a little work. It certainly expands the audience for the game, as surely many confronted Mega Man 9 two years ago only to die at the ends of Jewel Man one too many times and quit. Those same gamers can have an experience more on level with the difficulties of most games today, and breeze through the title.\r\n\r\nTechnically, the addition of an Easy Mode can't hinder the experience, because the gamer can simply choose to play on the normal difficulty if they wish. However, the fact remains that some players will cruise through the Easy Mode in a little over an hour, and fail to see what's so special about the Mega Man series. The fun comes in conquering the really tough challenges, in mastering each level layout one by one. When you're not simply compelled to overcome these hard circumstances to see the rest of the game, players become less likely to willingly go through it. More players can beat the game, but it's possible that less will actually be having fun.\r\n\r\nMega Man 10 also adds in a challenge mode with dozens of shorter challenges for the player to complete. Some are simply boss fights from the main game, but most are like very short levels that focus on one specific skill, like perfect jumping, or destroying a specific type of enemy. This feature would be perfect, if it weren't so tedious to retry a challenge. After you fail, the game spits you back out to the challenge menu, rather than simply including a \"retry\" button, which wastes a frustrating amount of time in-between each session.\r\n\r\nProto Man, before a paid DLC component, is included in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mega_Man_10\">Mega Man 10</a> from the get-go, giving a slightly different experience one can try. He is hurt more by each enemy blast, but he has a shield that protects him from many hits to compensate. That small difference, along with a sliding ability and the appearance change, are all the variety you get, but it's still certainly a welcome addition.\r\n\r\nMega Man 10 doesn't try to add too much to what made its predecessor successful, which is just fine. The gameplay is still pitch-perfect, and the additions all add up to make it a more solid product for a wider range of gamers.\r\n", "likes": 1, "slug": "ps3-game-review-mega-man", "introduction": "When Capcom released Mega Man 9 in 2008, it immediately became clear that there was a real market in making games like it's 1989.", "platform": 6, "created_at": 1457606351587, "id": 1629, "game": 1718, "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/mega-man-5/reviews/ps3-game-review-mega-man", "rating_category": 2, "username": "Charles JHines"}, {"error": ["Not found!"], "id": 1630}, {"title": "loli/20", "views": 279, "category": 1, "updated_at": 1457904608701, "content": "A game with an adorable main character, saya, and her journey to find true love.\r\n\r\nA very deep and meaningful game about friendship, humanity, romance, love, acceptance and flowers in a desert.\r\n\r\n11/10 I cry evertem.", "likes": 0, "slug": "loli-slash-20", "platform": 107, "created_at": 1457904593862, "id": 1631, "game": 15830, "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/saya-no-uta/reviews/loli-slash-20", "rating_category": 2, "username": "kimono"}, {"title": "I didn't wanted to do this review, but I am determined to make you play Undertale!", "views": 280, "category": 1, "updated_at": 1487769805209, "content": "Okay, enough with the odd call backs.\r\n\r\nHere's the deal.

(Yey, pokemon can follow you). First, the main plot, is the same thing as the original, but I kind had issues with the caves because for some reason they shrink in this remake.

I still miss the Battle Frontier in this one and ,odd enough, you can't fight against the leaders again.

Also the game is very rpg-like, in other words, you are the main character, this maybe is not important, but I see a lot people complaining about the lack of personality of the main character about this feature, so it always depends of your taste. The lore is awesome and made you want to know more about the universe of Dragon Age, it's so true that the story expanded to books and comics.

The narration jumps between a real time conversation involving a scribe and some random chick at a bar, then to the book they/he is writing, then to the events unfolding and finally to the game it'self. So it's kind of an off putting narration-ception... can I say that?\r\n The game starts easy and limits the buildings and stages you can take as a beginner, in what is to be a tutorial that makes up the entire campaign. The story promises all sorts of adventures, war, disease and the looming duty of royal city builder but after three or four maps of tutorial it finally gives up and decides the ultimate goal in the game is to build a bath house and roll credits. What a rip off! Yes there is 6 hours of promised story game play but literally all of it is spent in tutorial. The final building you are allowed to build is a bath and the moment you build it the king's buddy pops up and says the war's over, let's all go for a pint.\r\n The game is also buggy. Very buggy. Aside from the aesthetic bugs like birds being permanently stuck in buildings and the narrator repeating himself. There is no end of 'map-reset' bugs, like villagers not being able to reach their spots, traders blocking the harbor despite having left the map and  unable to place buildings anywhere for no reason.

Telltale are so talented when it comes to writing stories and characters, but the people in this game felt bland and rushed.

You now collaborate with cerberus and begin to investigate large number of abductions and disappearances of human colonies all over the Galaxy with the reapers being the Likely cause.

Many of the choices You made in the first game will also affect the plot and gameplay in this sequel as well as the last instalment of this trilogy Mass Effect 3. It is hard to give examples of many of these without giving away the plot. and I hate spoilers!!!\r\nOne of the best things so far in my eyes is the available choice of intimate relations with the characters in game depending on whether you're up for a bit of blue Asari tale or a steaming session with a kind of psychotic skinhead bird named Jack who could of Broke out of some rehab somewhere. The possibilities are endless!! At least if all else fails you can now show off your moves in the nightclub while also getting drunk at the bar, then come to a conclusion it's just easier to watch a stripper of an alien race. Not far from reality sometimes eh?? \r\n\r\nThis game is definitely credited for the outstanding performances by the voice actors who really brought this game to life. From great voice actor roles by Mark Meer/Jennifer hale who play shepard depending on the gender you pick, to Legends like D.C Douglas know by the  title “the voice-over Guy” who plays Legion.

There is roughly the same amount of weapons but there is the introduction of heavy weapons which can be picked up in various missions. A number of available DLCs are available which include different character outfits and included weapons within. Multiplayer action has now been brought to the table where the online players fight alongside each other against waves of cerberus or collectors. it is a fun mode of gameplay but I found it can be quite limited and irritating depending on the skill of the players you are with.\r\nThey have stepped up gameplay in many ways including better visual graphics with a lot smoother frame rate which of course is expected of a sequel. They have done very well with this considering the engine is for 360 and PS3.  There's a nice upgrade to the aiming system added points for headshots which all contribute in points for leveling up and increasing abilities of your selection as before.\r\nOne of my favourite things and elements of the game, the ship the Normandy has now undergone drastic changes and advancements. This includes an new armory, the crew’s own quarters, your own quarters including space for collectible items which i found amusement in collecting, to also Tech Labs where ship and character upgrades are available. The ship is now managed by an AI under the name EDI which is a cool idea. They have changed the galaxy map menu as well as limiting fuel for the ship which has to be purchased or discovered  throughout the Galaxy.

The immersion I felt was singularly different from any other game I have played, the minimalist feel of the home and the artful use of sounds made it really come alive.\r\n\r\nSome of the themes that you encounter in the game can be fairly deep as well. It isn't just some boring old story that has no depth. Nor does it dump you straight into the deep end without introducing you to the people involved first.\r\n\r\nSamantha is easily one of the most interesting characters I have encountered in such a short form game, and I never even really got to meet her.

Except about the way you treat women, where sexist attitudes are rewarded, unfortunately.\r\n\r\nThe Witcher is series from Poland, land of my ancestors. They seem to be very proud of this achievement, as the prime minister of Poland gave a copy of The Witcher 2 to President Obama.\r\n\r\nThe political issue in The Witcher has to do with a religious and military organization that hates non-humans (elves and dwarves, who represent the native peoples). Non-humans in turn are fighting for freedom and equal rights, appealing to guerrilla tactics and resistance. Druids represent environmentalists, helping non-humans when they can. Witchers, monster hunters, represent a small and powerful group of people who prefer to stay neutral, but that ends up being used by both sides of the conflict.\r\n\r\nThe game has several technical problems: missing information at crucial times, the combat system is bad, but what really disappoints is the sexism in a game that flirts with feminist statements, but ends up being sexist. In the game we see women in positions of power, leading the revolution against oppression, while the old trope of damsel in distress is repeated. Moreover, the sex scenes are presented aiming the straight audience, even when it is lesbian sex.\r\n\r\nGeralt is the typical male advocating for feminists, but always with a sexual interest. In the game you can choose not to have sex with every woman you help, but the opportunity exists, and that choice doesn't result in any problem.

Instead of a city under the sea, we have a city in the clouds, Columbia, which was founded by a prophet, Zachary Comstock, under the principles of Christian morality, white supremacy and American exceptionalism. Zachary Comstock is an allusion to Anthony Comstock, American politician who was a famous advocate of political moralism, censorship of offensive works and the prohibition of abortion. In his speeches, Anthony Comstock mainly attacked the anarchist writer Emma Goldman. Therefore, the player is constantly called anarchist. Instead of Emma Goldman, the game features Daisy Fitzroy, a black woman who leads the revolution in Columbia.\r\n\r\nThe main character, Booker Dewitt, is hired to rescue a girl named Elizabeth.\r\n\r\nThe central question of the game is: \"How do you wash the things you did?\". It's about redemption from sin, the same central question that drives the religious thought: how to be born again?\r\n\r\nDewitt is full of guilt. He killed Indians in the Battle of Wounded Knee. Baptism is a decision in the most radical sense of the term. It is the decision to die and be born again, to erase the past, to end your debt. But the theory of the multiverse complicates this decision because every choice we make creates a parallel universe that continues to exist. If you choose to convert, at the same you chose not to, which means that the result of your mistakes continues to exist in another universe, as well as the consequences of your sins. Ultimately, your sins cannot  be redeemed.\r\n\r\nThe same story is repeated in infinite realities. Some elements are constant, and others are variable, but it is the same story happening countless times: \"There is always a lighthouse, there is always a man, there is always a city\". How to prevent these realities to continue repeating? How to truly change history?\r\n\r\nMany things in this game reflect the first Bioshock, but in an unexpected way. Rapture and Columbia are two aspects of our society. Both work together and both result in the suffering of innocents. As Elizabeth concludes, these cities are propelled by the abuse of innocents. Here there is no room for children, for authenticity. Even individual freedom seems to be a small price to pay to prevent the loss of innocence, but the loss of innocence seems like an inevitable result of freedom. We can only save the innocence of others, at a great cost, because in our freedom we always end up losing our innocence.\r\n\r\nWe are stuck in a world where altruism and selfishness tend to complicate each other. You cannot break this cycle, you can only fight it, which at the same time causes it's movement and gives meaning to your actions. Individual freedom would thus be closed in a dialectic game in which your self-realization is at once your self-condemnation and your self-redemption. The price of choice is, in other words, trapping yourself on the absence of choice.\r\n\r\nCrazy talk isn't it? Considerations like these are the soul of Bioshock Infinite. But you can play just with it's soulless body. Just shoot things and go on like you used to. It's fun enough, but it will probably become boring if you are really into the \"art of shooting people on a screen\". Almost nothing of what makes FPS so famous works on Bioshock Infinite. If you play it like ir was just another shooter, you can end up claiming, like some guy did, that \"BioShock Infinite is the cancer that is killing videogames\". And it really is, depending on what you think \"videogames\" actually are. If you are expecting a good old and \"proper\" FPS where you can just imerse yourself in the lucid dream of performing a killing spree, you will be very disappointed. And the story will also make no sense to you.

But in this game (which is not a real RPG), it got tedious. Now, you don't HAVE to read anything in order to play the game, but if you want to get anything out of it, you should. The \"problem\" is that there is simply too much information. There is too much to read on the computers in the game. It gets kinda boring. \r\n\r\nIf we overlook the AMD issues, the graphics are OK.

I let some prisoners escape and it meant nothing, turning of the lights let me just drop down the building and finish the mission. The mask party was a great idea, but again, the non-lethal option was just letting someone else deal with it, rather than playing a game of intel.

And aims to tells a story of mysterious killings within a small town. The protagonist arives at the village, shortly before the killings, and has been told by his parent to live there for the next year. After some event, you and a group of friends take it upon yourselves to solve this mysterious and who, or what is behind the event.\r\n\r\nThe game has 2 main gameplay states. A turn-based RPG, set in randomly-generated dungeons, or a high-school sim where you are tasked with juggling you education and relations. \r\nThe first state lets your control up to four party members to take down the main enemies of the game, \"Shadows\", using their unique powers, taking the form of 'persona's'. The main protagonist can switch out his persona's allowing a lot of variety in how you play the game. And because of this, the battling never becomes too tedious. Depending on your dilligence, the game can shift between difficult and hard, so I suggest first timers take their time to grind for the first 2-3 bosses, or they may find themselves hitting a brick wall.\r\n\r\nThe second half of the game basically tasks you to map out your life, in order to max out your friendship with as many people as possble, as this will allow you to increase your teammates strength, and make more powerful personas. In order to complete every social link in the game within one playthrough, I had to follow a guide from day 1, and only had 1 week's worth of leeway. Not only this, some social links are necessary for progression, and some links can be completely locked out.\r\n\r\nThe game improves on the original by giving more social links, and an additional section near the end of the game. If you do not own a Vita, you will not be missing out on two much, however, this is definitely the preferred version of play. \r\n\r\nIf you have not played any Megami Tensei games, this is a great introduction to the series. The game is also an essential for for any RPG fan. This game would be considered a perfect 10 if it wasn't for a few reason's which most would call petty. The fact that a second playthrough of the game is necessary to fight the strongest boss in the game, at the very end no less, is a problem, in a story-driven, 70hr game. In order to complete the every social link, you need to take part in an annoying minigame, as well as the fact the first-time players can easily lose the oppurtunity to finish some social links due to story. I have also always had a problem with games that produce time limits to finish tasks, so anyone that does, I highly recommend you search for a Max Social Rank Guide.\r\n\r\nTherefore I give the game a Fantastic 9.", "likes": 0, "slug": "get-out-the-spreadsheets", "platform": 46, "created_at": 1474649559165, "negative_points": "-70hr game forces a second play through for one boss\r\n- Spreadsheet almost essential to fulfill all social ranks.", "id": 1764, "game": 2985, "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/persona-4-golden/reviews/get-out-the-spreadsheets", "rating_category": 2, "username": "DingleDongle"}, {"title": "A fun story let down by gameplay", "views": 128, "category": 1, "updated_at": 1474974622215, "positive_points": "Story\r\nMusic\r\nHD Art", "content": "A game that tries to be a  full console game, but is much more suited to that of a hand-held such as the vita.

You take a top down view attack enemies with a few weapon types. The game revolves around a stamina bar, which means you just end up running around, hit an enemy moving back and waiting for stamina to return. Boss battles reward you for totally ignoring the boss until after they've attacked, rather than it's goal of pushing the player to put himself in danger to attack before the enemy does. You're only in danger when an enemy damages you more than you expected, and this just becomes frustrating. On top of this you are given a timer to complete areas, forcing you to move in and out of levels multiple times. \r\n\r\nIf the gameplay was more enticing, I could see this game being a lot more popular, but as it stands, it's hard to recommend.\r\n", "likes": 0, "slug": "a-fun-story-let-down-by-gameplay", "platform": 48, "created_at": 1474655725953, "negative_points": "Boring Gameplay\r\nTime restricted action\r\n", "id": 1765, "game": 19796, "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-witch-and-the-hundred-knight-revival-edition/reviews/a-fun-story-let-down-by-gameplay", "rating_category": 2, "username": "DingleDongle"}, {"title": "c", "views": 132, "category": 1, "updated_at": 1474984049214, "content": "Unbelievable.

It’s all about Alto and a group of snowboarding friends shredding and rescuing llamas. The goal is to go as far as possible, whilst saving as many llamas as possible and performing as many tricks as you can.\n\nThe controls are simple, press A on the gamepad to jump or click the screen, the longer you hold it, the longer you’ll flip. As you play you’re given sets of challenges; complete these to level up. They’re not too difficult, a little frustrating at times, but it’s a nice feeling when you finally pull off that quadruple back-flip that’s been eluding you.\n\n\nThe only bad part is that the levels need to be fully finished before closing or you’ll have to redo any challenges you already did. Every ten levels you unlock a new character, each handles a bit differently which helps change up the gameplay a little. The first two are fairly quick, and can easily perform jumps whereas Pas is slow, and needs a lot of room to flip.\n\nThere’s not much bad about it, other than the grindy achievements and a handful of one-off bugs the game works well. The achievements are a little frustrating, there’s your run of the mill progression stuff, a few grinds, one million miles, and 100,000 llamas, on release they were glitched, and didn’t function. The devs patched that very quickly, so props to them. However, a decade on the slopes is estimated to take about 500 hours all told, so completionists may want to give this a pass.\n\nAll in all, it’s a fun, addictive little game which is clearly meant to be played in small doses on the go, it functions fairly well and has a pretty aesthetic.\n\nAlto's Adventure is free on Windows 10", "likes": 0, "slug": "c", "created_at": 1475360920661, "id": 1770, "game": 18130, "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/altos-adventure/reviews/c", "rating_category": 2, "username": "AchievementAddicts"}, {"title": "c", "views": 133, "category": 1, "updated_at": 1475461498841, "content": "FareGamings first release!

I didn't start playing this game until about a few years ago when a friend recommended it to me, I am so glad they did. It is my go-to strategy game to play. After all these years, the game still holds up.\n\nInitially you have 4 factions to choose from, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. A typical skirmish will have you face the choice of which route you'd like to go in regards to your military.You'll begin a usual game with a Supreme Commander which will serve as your constructor and defender for the opening of the game, from there you can choose to build a land factory, air factory, or naval factory - or any combination thereof. Going down a single avenue approach allows you to spend more of your resources on that particular branch of military.  Getting your factories up to Tech 3 from Tech 1 is a priority as any AI or human will attempt to overtake you with superior units.\n\n As far as economy goes, its a balancing act between mass, and energy. Making sure you are maximizing production while keeping your mass and energy in no short supply. Mass requires you to build mass extractors on specific mass nodes at first, but as you climb tech levels with your factories you will be able to purchase buildings which create mass for you at a high cost to energy. Energy production is fairly straight forward, you build small power generators at first and eventually will be able to construct large power generation structures. Power nodes on the map will give a boost to energy production, but is dependent on the map. Energy nodes are far fewer than mass nodes.\n\nBuilding units and overpowering your foe with them is not the only way to attain victory in this game. Experimental buildings as well as strategic missile systems can destroy an entire enemy base with ease, given they have not built the necessary counter to a strategic missile system. Overall there are a plethora of ways to win this game, there is no one sure fire way to victory. \n\nOne other thing to note about this game is its scale. You can play on maps ranging from 5km squared up to 80 km squared. The unit count is also maxed out at about 1000 units per side. With everything going on, its sometimes hard to keep track of everything going on.\n\nThis is an RTS game you really should not pass up, it is a fantastically fun game especially to play with friends.

The camera is always fixed to be behind Sonic, so if one wants to step back to activate a button, the camera does not rotate, hindering the player's vision.\r\n\r\nLevel Desing 2/10\r\nThe levels are almost always straight, with many obstacles in between, very narrow and boring sections, switches in which you have to step back to activate them, added to the above mentioned it makes a very stressful experience.

The devs, contributors, and testers are hard-working and dedicated to seeing the vision through Dondi, the lead developer, has for the game.\n\nIt's a hardcore survival game and just keeps getting harder and harder, which I'm all about.  I want this game to be as hard as humanly (dinosaurly?) possible, as do many others; I want to really have to work for the dino(s) I'd like to play as.  Well, the devs aren't letting me down on that front.  It's getting harder (will be even harder later), and I couldn't be more happy about it.  It has some sci-fi elements to it, with the testing on dinosaurs and humans (hypoendocerin, tissoplastic, neurotenic, cannibals), so this isn't a game that strives for realism as the main focus, but the fluidity of the game is \"realistic\" imo; you feel like a dinosaur.\n\nYou don't have to be a paleontologist to enjoy this game, you just have to enjoy survival and maybe animals.  I'm not this way or that way when it comes to dinosaurs; I mean, I like them, but I'm not a huge fan or anything.

It is quite tough, without a doubt, and if you don't enjoy this types of games, you might get quicly annoyed with it, but finally beating it gives you a satisfaction that you don't get in many games, trying to find new ways to beat the levels, especially the particuraly frustaing ones. The new classes and abilities are nice, although this time around it seems that magic is practically useless and the huge time it can take to form s bonds betwwen characters makes it difficult to get the children chraracters in the right moments, but then again, that challenge really forces you to adapt and change your way of playing. One thing i do have to say annoys me, is the bit much fanservice, even in the localized version it really is much, I know that japanese studios do this to sell more, but really?, considering the deep tones and difficulty of the series, it really seems silly that this is the thing that sellls. But apart from that, and perhaps the fact that there are no really deep meaningful changes depending on the bond you select, the game is excellent all-around, and if you like the series, or challenging strategie games, this is certainly a solid buy.

The gave is very immersive which is a huge plus.\n2.  ARK is challenging without overdoing the difficulty levels. \n3. There is a lot of customization on the gameplay itself within the settings. \n4. You can preset up the game to a play style that you, yourself, will enjoy. \n5. Ark is a fun game that once immersed into the game you can kill hours after hours playing.\n\nA specific element that stands out is the construction feature, it's done in a unique way that isn't displayed in such a manner. It doesn't pull hard on the game like you would expect even when using larger structures. \n\nProblems I noticed with the game are collision issues with the dinosaurs that cause them to become trapped/stuck in various objects within the game world preventing them from being able to move unless the player frees them by destroying the object they are stuck within or killing the dino. \n\nElements that excited me were the sheer number of skills that you can learn throughout the game, the changing weather and hot/cold effects, as well as the crafter custom recipes. \n\nThe element that I feel were dull had to be taming the skill is useful and will have to utilize this feature a lot but while taming there is very little interaction and little that can be done while taming (espically if you are soloing). \n\nOverall ARK is a great game especially if you like to work (or compete) with large numbers of people in a survival aspect / atmosphere.

Weapons feel \"weightless\" and unsatisfactory which is sad considering Goldeneye (1997) and Doom 2 (1994) taught the world how to create an AK-47 and a shotgun in a videogame. Exploration is totally absent due to the excessively linear scenarios that even take away from the player the classic left-or-right-path choice. Puzzles are just laughable, take a look at your notepad when prompted and if you can discern forms and colours you will overcome them.\n\nThe jumping and climbing feels rigged in your favour, verging on semi-automatic mode. Probably the price to pay for Drake's agile movement, brought to you by the marvellous Naughty Dog's Animation Department, that turns Uncharted 2 action and platforming sequences into truly playable stunt scenes, unlike other games which would simply take control away from you and play a cutscene because \"what you're about to see is too awesome for us to let you do it\".\n\nArtistically and graphically the game is mind-blowing. Be it long forgotten ruins, a war-ravaged town or a tibetan monastery built upon a precipitous mountain chain, the visual spectacle is guaranteed.\n\nThe story is adequate and better told, thanks to a cast of great voice actors and sharp dialogue lines that make characters credible and suit the mood that one expects of an adventure film. Uncharted 2 is the best Indiana Jones action videogame ever (notice the word \"action\", Fate of Atlantis excluded). They even managed to include some Nazi reference incidentally.\n\nThe game is far from perfect.

The only bad thing is some animations that could have been better, and give more animations to the protagonist to make it look more \"real\".\r\n\r\nHistory 8/10\r\nIt seems to be a simple story, a girl who is helped by two fireflies to escape from a laboratory in ruins, but actually conceals a darker and deeper than it appears. Leave a few ambiguities, but are details not closely related to the main story.\r\nHis narrative is good, there are few cutscenes, no dialogue, and there is no direct exposure.\r\n\r\nCharacters 7/10\r\nThere are not many characters in the story. Mion, the protagonist, is a simple but realistic character, she feels like a real girl (you show us her past life, her fears). The others are not very deep but have a credible background. I wish they had more time on the screen.\r\n\r\nGameplay: 8.5 / 10\r\nThe game does not seek to amuse, it seeks to deliver a message. We control the fireflies and the girl follows them, giving orders like pushing objects, going up or down stairs, activating switches, etc. It also has a somewhat irregular difficulty scale, but it succeeds in being a challenging side-scroller puzzle. In addition, the mechanics of the shadow firefly are creative, but could have drawn more potential.\r\n\r\nLevel Desing\r\nThis is very good, each level offers different challenges to avoid making it very monotonous. There are too many switches and doors, which might seem very realistic, but the stage (abandoned lab) gives way to that so it's no problem. However there are parts that are very boring and could have done better (* cof * * cof * chapter 4-1).\r\n\r\nSound 7/10\r\nThis game has a very good Sound-Track, but does not use it very well. There are places where it is almost imperceptible due to its low volume or is overshadowed by the many sounds of the objects on the stage, so it may go unnoticed, but fortunately it is not always so. I also think that they should have added dialogues or sounds to the protagonist (like Link's sounds in \"The Legend of Zelda\") to characterize her more.\r\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10\r\nI really enjoyed this game. Not for everyone but this work shows me that video games can be art.\r\n\r\nFinal note 8.1 / 10\r\nIf you are looking for a fun game, you probably will not enjoy it, but if you are people who want a good story, a challenging puzzle platformer, and / or a game with a message expressed in its playability, it is highly recommended.", "likes": 0, "slug": "protecting-a-loved-one", "created_at": 1483326475740, "id": 1825, "game": 20055, "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/htol-number-niq-the-firefly-diary/reviews/protecting-a-loved-one", "rating_category": 2, "username": "JasonArturoVegaAcuña"}, {"title": "c", "views": 61, "category": 1, "updated_at": 1483653250140, "content": "Inside is an astounding piece of digital art combined with a mediocre game.

Story\nIt is not complicated one but it keeps you going. It will definitely take you some time to get to the end of it. The big finale was pretty insteresting eventhough the last fight was very easy, although the boss looked cool. The main story has some twists, but nothing that surprising. It also had some awesome voiceovers, especially the robots :)\n\n2. Graphic\nBorderlands has definitely its own graphic style and even I played this game many years late, I still had no problems with the graphic quality. I had to get used to the style, but never had some major issues.\n\n3. Gameplay\nAlright. This one gets a little bit tricky. Some guns on some enemies acted weird and eventhough I hit 100% headshot, I didn't kill the enemy. The guns are pretty fun and it's nice that you have many options and can hold up to 4 guns at the same time. Also some other gears to put on later stage. Eventhough there is the car system and port system, there is going to be a lot of running. You can't go everywhere in your cart and shoot everything easy with it which I really liked because that would be just dumb. The gameplay itself could get sometimes repetetive and even intense because even with really good weapons and headshots it took a lot to kill the enemy and if there was more of them, well, then it was not pleasant. You get respawn though, but it cost you money. The money it cost is calculated on how much money you own at the moment which was nice. Also if you die you actually don't die right away and you get a chance to kill enemy which pops \"second wind\", basicly resurecting you on spot which was very handy. Although there was some weird things with some guns I enjoyed the gun play and the special class skill was also pretty cool.\n\n4. Final words\nFinishing this game took some time and I got sometimes a little bit bored, but it kept me going. Only thing what bothered me was that I had to clear some areas over and over again and a lot of running didn't help either. Nice touch is that you some enemies have different weak spots so you just dont go headshot everything. Story was decent and gameplay was enjoyable enough.\n\n7/10 - Good game", "likes": 0, "slug": "c", "created_at": 1488910369333, "id": 1876, "game": 21758, "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/borderlands-game-of-the-year-edition/reviews/c", "rating_category": 2, "username": "Stradivarius"}, {"title": "c", "views": 9, "category": 1, "updated_at": 1488910414533, "content": "Well this game was definitely crazy.

I know that.  It probably isn't even a good game.  It is much maligned by fans of the series.  But it was my first, and I love it, and I'll try to defend it in a rational way.  It is probably worth travelling back to 1982 to give it its due.  Crank up some Asia and compare it to games of the day and it doesn't look that bad.  If you played it on the PC you might be confused by why it looks so much worse than its predecessor.  Well, Ultima 1 got a face lift, but 2 and 3 did not.  So you get four color CGA graphics.  (Fan created patches not only fix the game breaking bugs of some releases, but also bump it up to 16 color CGA.)  Every numbered Ultima game from 1 to 9 got a brand new engine, and 2 implemented cities you could walk around rather than view the whole town at once in a different scale.  This opened up more exploration and secrets.  I've heard fans complain about the setting.  Back in the day you often had to rely on the manual to explain the story.  The reason why the game takes place on Earth is explained, so at least the inclusion of a space shuttle is a little more logical than in the first game.  Also, the time doors that predate the Moongates of future games are \"borrowed\" from the film Time Bandits, so there is even an explanation of why different technologies exist in different times.  (As a Rush fan, I hope that the inclusion of Earth in 2112 was no accident.)  \n\nSo that's my rationalization of the complaints I most often hear.  The actual game?  I'd call it average for the time.  There's a bad guy you have to take out, and there's a unique mechanic for the fight.  I'm not sure I'd have ever figured out the game without reading some hints, but once you know it its all pretty straightforward.  Increasing your stats is presented in an odd way.  Collecting the gold you need for health, armor, and said stat increases is tedious and slow even with shortcuts.  Getting required items as random drops off of thieves can make getting your first boat or plane really slow.  But being an elementary school kid in the 80's, taking turns with friends, the game had a kind of magic.  So my heart gives it an 8 though my brain knows it shouldn't be.

I was 11 during the 1986 World Series between the Mets and the Red Sox, and that was the series that got the initial hooks into me.  But it was a computer game really got me.  The lack of games available for my Tandy 1000 made it an easy decision to check it out.  While it was playable with a joystick, it was the depth of the simulation and manager mode that made the game special for me.  Also, it included a roster of real baseball players to manage.  You could have Hall of Famers from different generations go head to head to determine the best of all time.  But the one feature that was most important to me was the ability to add my own players.\n\nEvery year as baseball season started, I would dutifully pick up one of the preview magazines with the stats from the previous year.  I would make all star teams of current players to take on the all time greats.  I would take the time to enter entire modern teams and have them face off, managing against the AI.  I doubt there is any game in the last 30 years that I spent more time with than Earl Weaver Baseball.  While all sorts of sports games have implemented manage only modes since then, the simulation stands up even today.  (No one is going to hit 70 homers in a season of Earl Weaver.

Well the start was great, seeing what I can do, survival etc. At start I was owning the zombies without any major issues, then it became harder and also the going through tons of zombies became the problem, because you need to get better weapons, armor and stuff for sure, otherwise you are screwed. You travel a lot and here goes the problem, the zombies never stop spawning even when you cleared that spot a while ago. Yes, they are zombies, this is about killing zombies, hordes of them, but it quickly became huge annoyance unfortunately. Going through the same thing over and over again.\n\nI was actually thinking about not finishing this game because how much of doing the same thing over and over again on the same spot became annoying. Don't get me wrong, it's fun killing them and also there is the thing about day/night changes. You need to also clear the safe spot before you can make it your own and sleep there, sometimes that was really hard, didn't mind that much because I knew it's a goal to get it and they will stop spawning at some point. \n\nCrafting in this game was based on combing stuff together either you experimenting or finding the books placed by Kovak's, who became your guide.

I found it as annoyance more then fun, and main reasons for it were - if you played zoomout, you barely saw what you are picking up and also you couldn't just explore because you had to keep killing zombies over and over again eventhough you already killed them at that spot while ago. I decided to go with some guide where to find what so I could build better equipment because killing zombies became challenging.\n\nThe atmosphere and graphic of the game was pretty decent. You could also play more heroes and some had extra weapons or stuff you could use only with that \"class\". \n\nWhat I would love to be better in this game would be that zombies stop respawning to rapidly and killing them becomes boring and annoying more then fun as it was in the beginning. That would make many stuff in the game much more fun for me for sure. Some map troubles, but that was just small stuff. As for the last \"boss event\". Well it was something I kinda expected although some story things surprised me, so kudos on this.\n\nIt has interesting stuff going on for the game so I recommend it to play though, but like I said, less zombies would be more fun and make it more special. Oh and one last thing - what I also liked was that the survival bars didn't ever became annoynce. You want drink? Easy to get, food? sure, not that hard etc. And also it gave me a lot of time to fix that. Crafting was also interesting and was nice that you had to go to the world and find and combine stuff and explore and experiment.\n\n6/10 - Fair game", "likes": 0, "slug": "c", "created_at": 1490165045318, "id": 1910, "game": 7420, "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/how-to-survive/reviews/c", "rating_category": 2, "username": "Stradivarius"}, {"title": "c", "views": 2, "category": 1, "updated_at": 1490465494446, "content": "intersting puzzle/god game. not very varied but pretty chill, got it for like £3 on steam so not a bad buy", "likes": 0, "slug": "c", "created_at": 1490465494430, "id": 1911, "game": 3160, "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/from-dust/reviews/c", "rating_category": 2, "username": "TheFredobar"}, {"title": "c", "views": 3, "category": 1, "updated_at": 1490477581587, "content": "I played this game long time ago, but decided to play through again because I remembered I really liked the game. Yep, it stayed - I still do.\n\nThe atmosphere is awesome. You play different parts of military (ranger, pilot, squad, etc) and you are always part of the team. Even as sniper you go with your spotter and move from position to position, place to place to have that nice feeling shot, or not if you miss. There is even small story going on.\n\nThe graphic still holds in my opinion even 7 years later. It's decent. Sometimes it got little bit of tower defence and waves of enemies kept coming and coming till the event didn't finish, which was little bit off-puting, but sure. You kinda felt surrounded so it did a point. \n\nThere was still something different and what was very nice is the connection between the parts of military, like you finished something as squad-saved by helicopters-you switched to play one of the pilots to continue the missions. Something like that.\n\nThe \"main\" story parts were also supported greatly by very nice music. Nothing ground breaking, exactly what would you expect, but still it was good OST.\n\nI think this game definitely deserve:\n\n7/10 - Good game", "likes": 0, "slug": "c", "created_at": 1490477581579, "id": 1912, "game": 556, "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/medal-of-honor/reviews/c", "rating_category": 2, "username": "Stradivarius"}, {"title": "c", "views": 4, "category": 1, "updated_at": 1490526975507, "content": "Decent game with tight controls and great writing.

It feels like Van Helsing. The humor between the ghost and Van Helsing is very cool. The hidden joke quests are great. Also what was great for imergion was that if you killed something it stayed dead, you didn't have to clear the rooms over and over again. If you wanted though, you could go only to menu and opt in for it. \n\nThings which I didn't like was that many enemies seemed like just putted there, it was weird they are there. Kind of out of place. There was definitely a lot of mindless killing and yes, dying, because as Van Helsing style play (gun, sword) the ghost isn't a good tank for you so you will definitely tank a lot and also kite like a madman. \n\nThe last boss was decent. It was definitely good looking. As for the story it decent.
