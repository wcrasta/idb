14,"Bullfrog Productions",6,https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload//txwarwunab3jqi4gywf5.png,"Bullfrog Productions was a British developer. It was founded in 1987 by Les Edgar and Peter Molyneux. They were best known for their strategy god games such as Populous.

In January 1995, to strengthen its global positioning, Bullfrog Productions merged with long time publishing partner Electronic Arts. In August 1997, Bullfrog co-founder, Peter Molyneux, left to establish a new development team, Lionhead Productions (who, incidentally, has also signed a distribution deal with Electronic Arts). In September 1999, Les Edgar changed his role to consultant for Bullfrog Productions Limited, enabling him to pay more equitable attention to his other business interests. Edgar handed the reins to Bruce McMillan from Electronic Arts' Canadian studio.

Following its purchase by EA, Bullfrog continued to work in its original offices in Guildford as an EA studio, and continued to display its own Bullfrog logo on the boxes of its games. In 2000, Electronic Arts merged its EA-UK offices, which had been in Langley near Slough, with the Bullfrog offices, into a new facility in Chertsey. Around August of that year the company decided to drop all further production of Bullfrog-branded products, and the former Bullfrog employees were put onto new projects such as the Harry Potter series. The last Bullfrog-branded game was Sim Theme Park (also known as Theme Park World and Theme Park 2), released in 1999.

A few compilations of older games that Bullfrog worked on have been published since, but to all intents and purposes the brand has been dead since the move to Chertsey in 2000.

Many Bullfrog developers left to found their own studios and these became Intrepid Computer Entertainment Ltd., Big Blue Box Studios Ltd. and Lionhead Studios. The latter eventually absorbed the first two and became the only studio to carry on the Bullfrog legacy.","2011-03-01 08:43:37.000000",None

17,"Digital Extremes",3,https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload//rhyaabgxjwer5kifkiis.png,"Founded in 1993 by James Schmalz, Digital Extremes Ltd. proudly ranks as one of the world's top development studios in the interactive entertainment industry.
Headquartered in London Ontario, Canadaâs 10th largest city, Digital Extremes got its foothold early on in the game industry during the shareware craze of the early 90s. Epic Pinball was a ten month project written entirely in assembly language by Schmalz that went on to become one of the most successful shareware games ever made, trailing only behind such industry greats as Duke3D, Doom and Wolfenstein 3D. Sequels such as Silverball and Extreme Pinball were released shortly thereafter and together they helped fund the creation of what would become one of the industryâs blockbuster franchises, Epic Gamesâ UnrealÂ®.

Beginning in 1994, Digital Extremes partnered with Epic Games (at that time, its shareware publisher) and co-created Unreal and its counterpart Unreal Tournament. Both games set new standards for first-person action games and broke new ground in online multiplayer gaming. Tremendously rich graphics, fine-tuned gameplay, frenetic action and high quality production value are descriptions that have become synonymous with any Unreal branded game. To date, the award-winning Unreal franchise, including Unreal, Unreal Tournament and Unreal Championship has sold more than 12 million units worldwide across the PC, PlayStationÂ®2, Xboxâ¢ and Dreamcastâ¢ platforms.

Digital Extremes completed development on its original IP for the current generation of consoles, Dark SectorÂ®, which shipped to stores in 2008, using its proprietary next-gen technology, the Evolution Engineâ¢. Following its success, the studio expanded to two teams to allow for simultaneous development on separate projects.

Digital Extremes completed work on the Multiplayer component of 2K Gamesâ blockbuster, BioshockÂ® 2 as well as the PC version of THQ hit, Homefrontâ¢.  The company also recently ventured into the mobile world with the release of Retro Pinball for Appleâs iOS platform, a throwback to the companyâs roots.  More recently, Digital Extremes earned critical acclaim for the development of first-person action game, The DarknessÂ® II, based on the comic book series of the same name.  In addition, the company assisted Microsoft with additional multiplayer content to HaloÂ®4.  The studio is currently developing and publishing the Free-to-Play action game, Warframe","2011-03-04 12:54:51.000000",http://www.digitalextremes.com/

It took its name from the Norse deity Loki.

Although successful in its goal of bringing games to the Linux platform, the company eventually closed due to financial troubles, with it declaring Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Protection in August 2001 and finally being disbanded in January 2002.

Excerpt from their archived website:
""Loki Entertainment Software contracts with successful computer entertainment software companies to port their best selling titles to Linux. A freeware Unix-like operating system, Linux has been dubbed the only true competitor to Windows and has established a solid following in the United States and abroad. Gaming software is an untapped segment of the Linux market with significant potential.

Unlike commercial operating systems developed solely for profit, Linux truly represents the ""power of the people."" Created in 1991 by Linus Torvalds, a Finnish developer, and made available for free over the Internet, Linux is continually being enhanced by thousands of volunteer developers and programmers around the globe. New capabilities are routinely shared and contributed as software developers have molded the versatile operating system to fit their company's specific needs. While most commercial operating systems go through five to seven revisions per year, Linux might see multiple revisions in a day. There is a virtually unlimited and growing pool of talent supporting the product.

Loki Entertainment Software was founded in August, 1998 with the goal of bringing a broad range of games to Linux. Loki generates revenues for game publishers by bringing proven hits to this significant, new market. Just as Hollywood studios are able to supplement profits by re-releasing movies to video, pay-per-view and international markets, the ports developed by Loki enable publishers to generate additional revenues from existing products without incurring additional costs.

For Linux users, Loki brings best selling games, fully supported and sold through traditional retail channels -- something the Linux community has been lacking until now. We are very proud of our commitment to Linux, and are excited about bringing a rich gaming experience to our platform of choice.""","2011-03-18 04:37:29.000000",http://www.lokigames.com/

The company started by developing Nintendo 64 ports of successful games on other systems, including the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater series. Following the stability provided by the success of the ports, the company then branched out into developing its own original games on multiple platforms, including Pitfall: The Lost Expedition and Loadout.","2011-04-08 08:07:40.000000",http://www.edgeofreality.com/

""Founded in 1995, Global Star Software Limited was originally located in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada. The company became active in the software publishing field and branched out from its roots in value PC entertainment to offer a variety of business and utility software, as well as software for a variety of other platforms.

The company became a wholly owned subsidiary of Take-Two Interactive Software Canada, Inc., which in turn was a subsidiary of Take-Two Interactive Software Inc. Although controlled by Take-Two, the company remained intact and published games using its own logo as a publishing label.

In 2002 Global Star Software launched its Global ProBiz lineup of over a dozen business and utility products. Global Star also continued its efforts in the PDA software market, spearheading new initiatives such as multi-platform releases for both Palm and Pocket PC devices.

By the end of 2002, Global Star was reorganized and became a division of Take-Two's Jack of All Games' Canadian operations along with Triad Distributors. Shortly thereafter, Take-Two announced that Global Star's products would henceforth be sold exclusively through their Jack of All Games' sales force to strengthen the company's position in the value-priced product category. In mid 2003 Global Star Software, Inc. was formed and all distribution operations were consolidated operationally into the new company located within the Take-Two corporate facilities in New York City.

The Global Star Software label was absorbed into the 2K Play label when Take-Two announced its formation on 10th September 2007.""","2011-04-11 08:38:22.000000",None

543,"Rage Software",13,https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload//qmoaliayc4hgufdvtye1.png,"Rage Software or Rage Games or FX Digital Network was a British video game developer. Formed in Liverpool in 1992, its games were marked by an emphasis on graphical effects with arcade gameplay.

Rage's first title Striker sold more than one million copies throughout its two-year life cycle and established Rage as a major creative force in the interactive entertainment industry. The company went through rapid expansion in the 1990s and partnered with multiple third party software publishers for distribution of its titles.

Rage Games Limited was floated on the stock exchange in 1996 as Rage Software plc. Rage continued to form commercial partnerships with major publishing houses, including Microsoft, Intel, Dell, Compaq, Nintendo, Sony and Sega, and re-registered as a private company as Rage Software Limited in 1999.

In 2000, Rage began to expand into publishing. However, the costs of publishing and a run of games that did not sell as expected (most notably the David Beckham franchise) eventually led to the company closing in January 2003 due to bankruptcy. At that time, it was one of the oldest game developers in the UK and at its peak had offices in Liverpool, Birmingham, Sheffield, Newcastle, Bristol and Warrington.

Some of the former development staff have formed other game development companies such as Swordfish Studios in Birmingham, Juice Games in Warrington and Venom Games in Newcastle.","2011-10-04 12:23:36.000000",None

Whether your project needs our help from the initial concept phase, or it just needs a good kick in the pants on its way out the door, we are here to help. 
 
We encourage all of you artists and fans to support independent artists worldwide by seeking them out, spreading the word about things that are good, and paying a fair price for their product as directly as possible. Because it matters. 
 
Thanks for stopping by. Let's get a beer sometime! 
 
Devolver won't just release your film. We take on just a few titles at a time, so we can jump in with both feet and treat each one like we made it ourselves. 
 
We craft a unique strategy for every title, with an aim to place it on all the right platforms in the best possible order to maximize your return and visibility. 
 
Digital distribution is changing fast - new outlets spring up every week, old ones falter, and the ecosystem changes constantly. That's why we're always adding finesse and up-to-the-minute options to craft the very best strategy for your film. We work hard to retain the best relationships for placement on existing platforms, and we're always adding new ones when they start doing enough business to matter for you. 
 
We love to get our hands dirty to reach your fans in all the places they might be found â and we'll help you make the most noise, so those fans can find you.","2011-10-07 19:59:58.000000",http://www.devolverdigital.com/

The studio worked as a sub-contractor on a number of titles before moving onto its first unique project, Sony-published retro shooter Gravity Crash, in 2008. PS3 and PSP versions released in 2009/2010.

JAW went on to sign a far-reaching contract with Lorne Lanningâs Oddworld Inhabitants to develop properties in the Oddworld franchise, a move Gilray describes as a âturning pointâ. Oddworld: Strangerâs Wrath HD, a conversion of the 2005 original, released in 2010 for PC then a year later for PS3, then followed in 2012 for PlayStation VITA.

Towards the end of development on Strangerâs Wrath HD, the team moved over to start development on what would become Oddworld: New ânâ Tasty for PS4, Xbox One, PS3, VITA, PC, Mac and Linux.

Oddworld: New ânâ Tasty launched in July 2014 on PS4 to critical acclaim, with other platforms arriving in the months following. The title did well to beat its own 12 month sales prediction within 2 months of release.

The team also revisited their title Gravity Crash, by creating a PlayStation VITA version titled Gravity Crash Ultra, released in August 2014. 2014 and 2015 has seen JAW work with new Partners and Clients.

The team are incredibly proud of the titles theyâve worked on, as they have received critical acclaim, achieving metacritic scores in excess of 80.","2011-11-29 07:53:05.000000",http://www.jawltd.com

928,"Supergiant Games",6,https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload//ughtfknjcbclqblifp5h.png,"Supergiant Games is an American video game development company based in San Jose, California. It was founded in 2009 by Amir Rao and Gavin Simon, and currently consists of employees in San Jose and other locations. Several of its team members were former developers from the Electronic Arts Los Angeles studio, which developed the Command &amp; Conquer series of video games.

Their first game, Bastion, received high critical praise, including being listed among several ""Game of the Year"" lists from game journalists. It was first shown in mid-development at the 2010 Penny Arcade Expo as part of its ""PAX 10"" highlight ten upcoming independently developed games. This attracted several publishers who wanted to help distribute the game, but Supergiant Games found that Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment shared the same vision they had for the game. Supergiant selected them as their publishing partner, enabling them not only to distribute the game to Xbox Live Arcade but as a premiere title during the 2011 ""Summer of Arcade"" promotion.

In March 2013, Supergiant Games announced their next title, Transistor, released on May 20 2014. A promotion video was released March 19. The game features a female protagonist, Red, in a cyberpunk-like city, who had gained possession of a powerful weapon that she is nearly killed for possessing. The game features a similar isometric viewpoint to Bastion. Transistor was similarly met with critical acclaim with an average critic score of 83 on Metacritic.","2013-03-25 15:23:58.484999",http://www.supergiantgames.com

1022,"Turn 10 Studios",12,https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload//qtkg089mtfwctcvn480m.png,"Located in Redmond, Washington, Turn 10 Studios is the creator of the Forza Motorsport franchise. 

Turn 10 is a subdivision of Microsoft Studios, established in 2001 as a first-party racing game developer. Turn 10 Studios began working on the original Forza Motorsport to fill the void of simulation racing games on the Xbox console. With an emphasis on driving mechanics and the newest features of Xbox LIVE, the original Forza Motorsport was released in May of 2005 to much critical acclaim and community support. 

Building off its success, Turn 10âs team immediately began working on a sequel intended to be released on Microsoftâs new Xbox 360 console. Forza Motorsport 2 was released in May of 2007, pushing the boundaries of User Generated Content (UGC) with a robust livery editor and online Auction House, giving casual players new options for expressing their creativity on and off the track. With new online tools, the Forza community thrived as painters, tuners, seller, and racers shared their creations via Forzamotorsport.net. 

In late 2007, Turn 10 Studios began an intense development process for the next Forza installment. Our most ambitious project to date, Forza Motorsport 3 boasted enhanced graphics, driving physics, and UGC. Turn 10 released the game in October 2009 to critical and commercial success. 

Released in October of 2011, Forza Motorsport 4 brought even more excitement to the franchise with Kinect integration, including the stunning Autovista experience. With hundreds of cars rendered in stunning detail, and new tracks to hone skills on, Forza Motorsport 4 was another resounding success for Turn 10 Studios. 

With Forza Horizon, the Forza universe expanded to the open road. Action racing put the player in an open world that demands driving skill and rewards driving style. With lots to explore and a cutting-edge soundtrack to compliment the scenery, Horizon was an evolution of the authentic Forza experience.
 
In 2013, Turn 10 released Forza Motorsport 5, the first Forza Motorsport game to appear on the newest Xbox console, Xbox One. Featuring astonishing graphics and cutting-edge features like cloud-powered Drivatar opponents, Forza Motorsport 5 is a landmark racing game that defined the next generation of consoles and continues to appeal to Xbox fans across the world.
 
Forza Horizon 2 was released in 2014, featuring the wide-open spaces of Southern Europe to explore in hundreds of realistic, real-world cars. With a full day-night cycle and dramatic weather effects, Forza Horizon 2 was hailed by fans and critics alike for its beautiful visuals and emphasis on pure fun. In March 2015, Turn 10 released Forza Horizon 2 Presents Fast &amp; Furious, a standalone expansion for Forza Horizon 2, inspired by the Fast &amp; Furious film series and featuring many of the cars from Universalâs blockbuster action film, Furious 7.","2013-06-25 16:58:17.427999",http://www.forzamotorsport.net/en-us/turn10

Andy and Marco built the Bluepoint Engine from the ground up, and put the engine to the test in developing the first downloadable game for the PlayStation Network.

Pluto 13 GmbH was founded in 2002 by employees and management of Piranha Bytes Software GmbH. Piranha Bytes Software GmbH was itself founded in 1997 and later (1999) turned into a 100% subsidiary of Phenomedia AG, a company listed on Germanyâs Neuer Markt stock exchange. In 2001 the first GOTHIC game was released to the public. In May 2002 Phenomedia AG went into insolvency proceedings due to irregularities for which several former group managers (not Piranha Bytesâ management!) have been tried for in a German criminal court of law.

It was therefore decided to make a clean cut and negotiate an MBO with the administrator, which was concluded in September 2002. Pluto 13 GmbH was founded and major assets, trademarks and most staff were transferred to the new company. One of the four original founders remained with the team in a leading position.

Pluto 13 GmbH is a privately owned limited liability corporation under German law, all shares are held by staff and management.

In the last years we gathered ample experience developing award-winning games, employing highly optimized workflows and making a name for ourselves in the games industry.
Founded in January 2011, we evolved from casual to core game development with currently 19 team members.
We love great games, we value quality, passion and art, and our products are meant to reach the masses.

There are three pillars that build the foundation of our studio:
Creativity - Taking a fresh approach to existing genres with instantaneously recognizable art styles.
Production - Always delivering on time and on budget. Even for first-time projects and challenges.
Technology - Consecutively enhancing our efficiency and product quality via modularized in-house framework.

If we do it, we do it right â including work-for-hire projects, which will receive as much love as our own. If we agree to work on them.
We are consistently growing by accessing multiple game design universities and freelance professionals, identifying the best talent only.
Mimimi Productions is a registered developer for all relevant platforms and is working with the Unity 3D-engine since 2010.","2013-07-01 04:33:49.572999",http://www.mimimi-productions.de/

1234,"System 3 Software",6,None,"Formed in 1982 by Mark Cale, System 3 is recognised as one of the founding pioneers of the gaming industry and as a name synonymous with producing original genre defining gaming concepts year on year. System 3 stands proud as the last surviving British Independent Publisher from those grass roots years

2012 marked System 3â²s 30th anniversary, a monumental occasion in the companyâs long and fruitful history!

From early 8-bit Commodore 64 and the Sinclair Spectrum machines, through the days of 16-bit Commodore Amiga and Atari ST formats right up to and beyond the phenomenal Sega, Nintendo, PlayStation and Xbox console boom, the company has brought a unique gaming style to new formats as and when they enter the market.

In the mid 1980â²s International Karate was a huge hit, attaining global recognition as the first game from a European publisher to hit the number one spot in the prestigious US Billboard Charts. What followed is true gaming folklore. Hailed as the most original series of games for a generation The Last Ninja and Last Ninja 2 set the standard in arcade adventuring, hitting number one around the world and garnering the company with armfuls of awards by the turn of the decade. Making up the final part of the historic trilogy Last Ninja 3 became the only game to date to be awarded a 100% review in Commodore User Magazine.

As the market began to lean more and more towards licenses and franchises, Myth: History in the Making, Putty Squad and Constructor continued to showcase System 3â²s development ethos for producing truly original gaming experiences for everyone.

In 2007 System 3 entered into an agreement with Ferrari, the worlds most prestigious and instantly recognisable car brand. With one eye on producing a super-slick original racing game befitting the name and another on developing the definitive race game engine, Ferrari Challenge: Trofeo Pirelli was born.

A critical success and widely regarded as the best racing simulation available today, the game has gone on to form the bedrock of ongoing plans to continue to produce original games for all genres and, in particular, technically superior video racing games for many years to come.

In 2010 System 3 began the process of welcoming back one of its most popular IPs; Putty. Putty Squad is set for release on PS3, Vita and Apple formats in 2013.

System 3 produces games for the key hardware platforms including; Nintendo Wii, Nintendo DS, Nintendo 3DS, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, PlayStation Portable, PSP go, PlayStation Vita, Xbox 306, Windows-based personal computers and mobile phone applications.","2013-07-17 11:00:25.894999",http://www.system3.com/

They have been a popular developer in Japan with games like Photoboy for the PC Engine and In the Hunt for the arcades, Sega Saturn, PlayStation, and PC. Irem is also known for making their arcade games extremely difficult, and most of them feature a dip switch that allows you to play a ""no death mode"" as a result, in order to allow gamers to be able to complete their tough games.

As a result of the 2011 TÅhoku earthquake and tsunami, Irem canceled the majority of its remaining video game projects, including Zettai Zetsumei Toshi 4: Summer Memories and Poncotsu Roman Daikatsugeki Bumpy Trot 2. Irem re-focused to become primarily a slot-machine and pachinko developer, the industry it was in before turning to video games. Its video game division was dissolved in April 2011 and many Irem designers, including producer Kazuma Kujo, gathered to form a new company called Granzella to continue creating games.","2013-07-25 20:06:37.569999",http://www.irem.co.jp

All three of them previously worked together at Infogrames as a part of the internal Eden development group. By forming the company, Eden became independent. The studio initially signed contracts with Infogrames for two V-Rally games, but asserted its independence by signing a publishing agreement with Electronic Arts in 1999.

In May 2002 the company was sold to the Infogrames Group (that later became Atari), which already held 19.8% of the company's shares. In September 2003 the name was changed to Eden Games S.A.S.

Most recently, the studio is known for the Alone in the Dark reboot (2008) and the Test Drive Unlimited series.","2014-01-26 09:49:20.664999",http://www.edengames.com

The studio consisted largely of existing Capcom R&amp;D talent, who had formed the company (then called Studio 9) to give themselves greater executive control (and thus creative freedom), like Sega's semi-autonomous studios in the early 2000s. The studio focused largely on creating new intellectual property rather than sequels. When these failed to perform on par with Capcom's more popular series, Capcom attempted to merge the studio back into their internal R&amp;D. Those at the studio chose instead to leave the company, and Clover was dissolved.

Some of the key members of Clover founded Seeds Inc., a new development group that merged with ODD Incorporated in October 2007 to form PlatinumGames, which has since built up a staff composed of former Clover staff. Other members (including the art director of Åkami) went to join Ignition Entertainment at their Tokyo development studio.""","2014-01-26 09:54:21.463999",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clover_Studio

2262,"NIS America",6,https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload//kltxrldhcs8xsum9gs7b.png,"Nippon Ichi Software was founded in September 1991 in Gifu Prefecture, Japan, as an entertainment software company. It was relocated and reincorporated on July 12, 1993. Since then Nippon Ichi Software, Inc. has grown into an international company focused on creating video game products across modern console platforms. NIS America, Inc. subsidiary of Nippon Ichi Software, Inc. of Japan, established its North American operations on December 24, 2003. Based in Santa Ana, California, NIS America, Inc. handles operations including localization, marketing, and publishing of Nippon Ichi titles. The first game to be released in North America by NIS America was Phantom Brave.

NIS America was the result of the company's wish to focus on international publication of their works in the U.S., given the increased popularity of their titles. Prior to the creation of this subsidiary, NIS software titles that appeared in the U.S. were localized and distributed by outside publishers. Notable examples would be Disgaea: Hour of Darkness, published in North America by Atlus and in Europe by Koei, La Pucelle, published in North America by Mastiff Inc, and Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure which was also published in North America by Atlus. The publisher has become a somewhat of a well-known presence in the North American market, having won RPGLand's ""Stateside Publisher of the Year Award"" in 2009.","2014-02-08 01:28:16.460000",http://nisamerica.com/

3772,"Ultimate Play the Game",26,https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload//uer8wf2ungnylqzkjpwd.png,"Ultimate Play The Game (often shortened to Ultimate) was a video game developer in the 1980s. 
Ultimate released a series of successful games for the Sinclair ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, BBC Micro, MSX and Commodore 64 computers from 1983 until its closure in 1988. Ultimate are perhaps best remembered for the big-selling titles Jetpac and Sabre Wulf, each of which sold over 300,000 copies in 1983 and 1984 respectively, and their groundbreaking series of isometric arcade adventures utilising a technique termed Filmation. Knight Lore, the first of the Filmation games, has been retrospectively described in the press as ""seminal ... revolutionary"".

By the time of the label's last use in 1988 on a retrospective compilation, Ultimate had evolved into Rare, and moved on to developing titles for Nintendo consoles. Rare was purchased by Microsoft in 2002 for US$377 million, a record price for a video game developer, and now develops exclusively for Microsoft's Xbox One console. In 2006, Rare revived the ""Ultimate Play The Game"" name for an Xbox Live Arcade remake of Jetpac named Jetpac Refuelled.","2014-10-16 10:39:24.302000",None

We grow up on playing retro games. Our purpose is to pursue and to evolve more the fun of them.

NIGORO is not a game company. To be exact, NIGORO is a game development department of ASTERIZM corporation. The games are developed by NIGORO members have released as a brand name âNIGOROâ. We may also sell on behalf of other game developers. In that case, they have released as a brand name âASTERIZMâ.
It is hard to understand. lol.

In the United States, indie Games has considerable demand, and many developers have been successful. In Japan, when it comes to a genre called âDOUJINâ, there are successes. On the other hand when it comes to a genre called âINDIEâ, there are few successes. On top of that, indie games themselves are not so popular.

In that circumstances, we have the ambition to be successful Japanese indie games and hope to boost Japanese indie game development field which like-minded people. We are working with such thoughts. Thanks.""","2014-10-29 11:01:08.835999",http://nigoro.jp/en/

We create hidden horror games â focusing on the atmosphere and the environment, rather than survival and shooter mechanics. Bloober Team ventures Behind The Darkness.
Bloober Team has been established in 2008. During the first few years the company has worked as a developer for hire. It has produced more than 40 different SKUâs during that time. Then came Basement Crawl and its reimagination  in the form of BRAWL, which steered Bloober Team back to its roots - to horror games. The company has worked directly with companies like Nintendo, Microsoft, or Sony.
Layers of Fear (2016) was the first game from Bloober Teamâs new horror portfolio, sealing the new vision of Bloober Team for the years to come.","2015-01-16 13:33:56.897000",http://www.blooberteam.com/

Project Reality was begun 11 years ago with the objective of bringing a greater sense of reality to EAâs Battlefield franchise style of gameplay. It is still active 10 years later and has won many accolades including being inducted into Mod DBâs mod Hall of Fame in December 2010. The core of Offworld Industries has been working together for the better part of a decade on and off, and have finally reached the point where they were confident they could make it on their own and development standalone games.","2015-04-07 06:13:28.107000",https://press.joinsquad.com/

The company continued to create PC games and in 1999, the company was divided into two separate entities: Paradox Interactive, which focused on creating grand strategy games for PC, and Paradox Entertainment, which focused on creating board and role-playing games.

In January 2012, the company divided yet again into two companies, becoming Paradox Interactive and Paradox Development Studio. Paradox Interactive became the game publisher focused on PC games of various genres and Paradox Development Studio became the game development studio focused on grand strategy games.

The game development studio was one of the first video game developers to create games in the grand strategy genre, and most of the games the studio has developed falls into that category. Grand strategy games are historical strategy games that usually cover the entire world map and include elements such as economy, diplomacy and warfare.","2015-12-08 15:06:14.125999",https://www.paradoxplaza.com/

Just two nice guys, but mostly awful, who love creating things. The dynamic duo was passionate about playing and designing games that they would love to play. They wanted to create games that were entertaining and also brought back childhood memories of your favorite games. Fun and humor always being in the forefront with the holy mission of making awesome games for all.

In their eyes a game can truly be a piece of art and for them, games provide a new way of interacting with art. The games platform is the perfect medium for bringing their creations and ideas to life. They strive to make games they would enjoy playing. Plus, there is the huge perk of having complete creative control and knowing they are building their next big game to play with.","2016-01-12 07:36:39.951999",http://www.awfullynicestudios.com/

&#13;
Michael Peiffert was a senior art director in the web design industry. In the past, he has won several prizes for his work on user-experience and design. In 2010, he founded his one-man company, Mi Clos Studio, and began his career in the game design industry. His first game was released in 2011: Space Disorder. Michael loves Doom and is the 15th best player in France on the Xbox Live Street Fighter IV. FibreTigre has been writing interactive fiction for 12 years and has released a couple of serious/experimental games. He has written about video games in French publications, such as Wired France. FibreTigre loves turn-based games such as Gladius and X-Com and has finished both Dark Souls. Michael and FibreTigre met twice, first when Michael was pitching Space Disorder at a lecture, then when FibreTigre made a lecture about Gamebooks and their influence on modern video games. Since they both loved sci-fi, they agreed to embark on the Nomad for the Out There adventure. During Out There, FibreTigre crafted the text and the game design, whereas Michael took care about everything else: coding, art direction, graphic assets and communication. They created Out There with nearly no budget, working part time. Difficult times, but these difficulties reflected in the harsh perils and loneliness the players can experience with Out There.&#13;

The studio's first project, GoNNER, will be the first commercial release for Ditto after having released several smaller and well-regarded prototypes on itch.io.

Joining Ditto on GoNNER is sound designer Martin Kvale, who met Ditto by the purest of luck at a visual arts festival in Karlshamn, Sweden, when he mistakenly thought Ditto was a different friend of his. A few drinks later, it didn't matter anymore. Joar Renolen, a talented composer and longtime friend of Martin's, joined the team shortly after.""","2016-05-06 11:26:24.832999",None

The focus, she decided, would be games with emphasis on narrative and simple but robust design. She already had a small part time project, Capitals, running with Sebastian Alonzo and Markus HellstrÃ¶m - but the time had come to make games with all engines running on full throttle. 

Talecore Studioâs goal is to create experiences that engage the heart and challenge the brain - experiences that make you feel and think. The studio will not hesitate to deal with heavy subjects and more mature themes than you might be used to from other games. Just like literature and movies can range from comedy via the very dark to the thought-provoking, so should games. It is simply a part of the industry showing that it is growing up.","2016-05-21 04:34:27.293999",http://www.talecore.com

Being in that kind of business never really put any restrictions what the targeted market or the audience is. Kupi Key was formed in 2012, by one person, Jurica Å inko, being a little genius he is, he soon started being very successful and he realized that way more opportunities lie in making his own video games. In May 2015. he took a risk and formed Just1337 Studio, putting together 4 friends, on a mission to create their own video games, that they all so love and on who they grow up. The learning process, making the team work together, understanding what the market standards are, took about 5 months, and in October 2015 the first game was ready for release. Since then, some things of course changed and the team grow even bigger. The studio is focusing more on 2D games for now, with a big appetite to go into 3D in time. That being said, both games that this studio has behind them are 2D, each evolving in a incredible pace and complexity. Big things lay in front of us, so stay tuned.","2016-05-25 08:32:55.719000",http://www.just1337.com/

Our common portfolio counts titles such as Prince of Persia, Far Cry, Kane & Lynch, Total Overdose, Game Globe, Max: The Curse of Brotherhood, Freedom Fighters and The Division. 
 
Our motto is simple: Co-op First. The goal is to take co-operative gameplay to the next level and to make great games, focused on the core gamer.  
 
We want to turn Ghost Ship Games into a solid game studio, able to compete with other mid-size game studios on Steam, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. As a small, new developer we will have to pick our projects with care, but together we have the skill, the experience, and the passion to create something truly fantastic.","2017-02-13 11:35:12.437000",http://www.ghostship.dk

In January 1995, to strengthen its global positioning, Bullfrog Productions merged with long time publishing partner Electronic Arts. In August 1997, Bullfrog co-founder, Peter Molyneux, left to establish a new development team, Lionhead Productions (who, incidentally, has also signed a distribution deal with Electronic Arts). In September 1999, Les Edgar changed his role to consultant for Bullfrog Productions Limited, enabling him to pay more equitable attention to his other business interests. Edgar handed the reins to Bruce McMillan from Electronic Arts' Canadian studio.

Following its purchase by EA, Bullfrog continued to work in its original offices in Guildford as an EA studio, and continued to display its own Bullfrog logo on the boxes of its games. In 2000, Electronic Arts merged its EA-UK offices, which had been in Langley near Slough, with the Bullfrog offices, into a new facility in Chertsey. Around August of that year the company decided to drop all further production of Bullfrog-branded products, and the former Bullfrog employees were put onto new projects such as the Harry Potter series. The last Bullfrog-branded game was Sim Theme Park (also known as Theme Park World and Theme Park 2), released in 1999.

A few compilations of older games that Bullfrog worked on have been published since, but to all intents and purposes the brand has been dead since the move to Chertsey in 2000.

Many Bullfrog developers left to found their own studios and these became Intrepid Computer Entertainment Ltd., Big Blue Box Studios Ltd. and Lionhead Studios. The latter eventually absorbed the first two and became the only studio to carry on the Bullfrog legacy.","2011-03-01 08:43:37.000000",None

12393,"Digital Extremes",3,https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload//rhyaabgxjwer5kifkiis.png,"Founded in 1993 by James Schmalz, Digital Extremes Ltd. proudly ranks as one of the world's top development studios in the interactive entertainment industry.
Headquartered in London Ontario, Canadaâs 10th largest city, Digital Extremes got its foothold early on in the game industry during the shareware craze of the early 90s. Epic Pinball was a ten month project written entirely in assembly language by Schmalz that went on to become one of the most successful shareware games ever made, trailing only behind such industry greats as Duke3D, Doom and Wolfenstein 3D. Sequels such as Silverball and Extreme Pinball were released shortly thereafter and together they helped fund the creation of what would become one of the industryâs blockbuster franchises, Epic Gamesâ UnrealÂ®.

Beginning in 1994, Digital Extremes partnered with Epic Games (at that time, its shareware publisher) and co-created Unreal and its counterpart Unreal Tournament. Both games set new standards for first-person action games and broke new ground in online multiplayer gaming. Tremendously rich graphics, fine-tuned gameplay, frenetic action and high quality production value are descriptions that have become synonymous with any Unreal branded game. To date, the award-winning Unreal franchise, including Unreal, Unreal Tournament and Unreal Championship has sold more than 12 million units worldwide across the PC, PlayStationÂ®2, Xboxâ¢ and Dreamcastâ¢ platforms.

Digital Extremes completed development on its original IP for the current generation of consoles, Dark SectorÂ®, which shipped to stores in 2008, using its proprietary next-gen technology, the Evolution Engineâ¢. Following its success, the studio expanded to two teams to allow for simultaneous development on separate projects.

Digital Extremes completed work on the Multiplayer component of 2K Gamesâ blockbuster, BioshockÂ® 2 as well as the PC version of THQ hit, Homefrontâ¢.  The company also recently ventured into the mobile world with the release of Retro Pinball for Appleâs iOS platform, a throwback to the companyâs roots.

It took its name from the Norse deity Loki.

Although successful in its goal of bringing games to the Linux platform, the company eventually closed due to financial troubles, with it declaring Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Protection in August 2001 and finally being disbanded in January 2002.

Excerpt from their archived website:
""Loki Entertainment Software contracts with successful computer entertainment software companies to port their best selling titles to Linux. A freeware Unix-like operating system, Linux has been dubbed the only true competitor to Windows and has established a solid following in the United States and abroad. Gaming software is an untapped segment of the Linux market with significant potential.

Unlike commercial operating systems developed solely for profit, Linux truly represents the ""power of the people."" Created in 1991 by Linus Torvalds, a Finnish developer, and made available for free over the Internet, Linux is continually being enhanced by thousands of volunteer developers and programmers around the globe. New capabilities are routinely shared and contributed as software developers have molded the versatile operating system to fit their company's specific needs. While most commercial operating systems go through five to seven revisions per year, Linux might see multiple revisions in a day. There is a virtually unlimited and growing pool of talent supporting the product.

Loki Entertainment Software was founded in August, 1998 with the goal of bringing a broad range of games to Linux. Loki generates revenues for game publishers by bringing proven hits to this significant, new market. Just as Hollywood studios are able to supplement profits by re-releasing movies to video, pay-per-view and international markets, the ports developed by Loki enable publishers to generate additional revenues from existing products without incurring additional costs.

For Linux users, Loki brings best selling games, fully supported and sold through traditional retail channels -- something the Linux community has been lacking until now. We are very proud of our commitment to Linux, and are excited about bringing a rich gaming experience to our platform of choice.""","2011-03-18 04:37:29.000000",http://www.lokigames.com/

""Founded in 1995, Global Star Software Limited was originally located in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada. The company became active in the software publishing field and branched out from its roots in value PC entertainment to offer a variety of business and utility software, as well as software for a variety of other platforms.

The company became a wholly owned subsidiary of Take-Two Interactive Software Canada, Inc., which in turn was a subsidiary of Take-Two Interactive Software Inc. Although controlled by Take-Two, the company remained intact and published games using its own logo as a publishing label.

In 2002 Global Star Software launched its Global ProBiz lineup of over a dozen business and utility products. Global Star also continued its efforts in the PDA software market, spearheading new initiatives such as multi-platform releases for both Palm and Pocket PC devices.

By the end of 2002, Global Star was reorganized and became a division of Take-Two's Jack of All Games' Canadian operations along with Triad Distributors. Shortly thereafter, Take-Two announced that Global Star's products would henceforth be sold exclusively through their Jack of All Games' sales force to strengthen the company's position in the value-priced product category. In mid 2003 Global Star Software, Inc. was formed and all distribution operations were consolidated operationally into the new company located within the Take-Two corporate facilities in New York City.

The Global Star Software label was absorbed into the 2K Play label when Take-Two announced its formation on 10th September 2007.""","2011-04-11 08:38:22.000000",None

12919,"Rage Software",13,https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload//qmoaliayc4hgufdvtye1.png,"Rage Software or Rage Games or FX Digital Network was a British video game developer. Formed in Liverpool in 1992, its games were marked by an emphasis on graphical effects with arcade gameplay.

Rage's first title Striker sold more than one million copies throughout its two-year life cycle and established Rage as a major creative force in the interactive entertainment industry. The company went through rapid expansion in the 1990s and partnered with multiple third party software publishers for distribution of its titles.

Rage Games Limited was floated on the stock exchange in 1996 as Rage Software plc. Rage continued to form commercial partnerships with major publishing houses, including Microsoft, Intel, Dell, Compaq, Nintendo, Sony and Sega, and re-registered as a private company as Rage Software Limited in 1999.

In 2000, Rage began to expand into publishing. However, the costs of publishing and a run of games that did not sell as expected (most notably the David Beckham franchise) eventually led to the company closing in January 2003 due to bankruptcy. At that time, it was one of the oldest game developers in the UK and at its peak had offices in Liverpool, Birmingham, Sheffield, Newcastle, Bristol and Warrington.

Some of the former development staff have formed other game development companies such as Swordfish Studios in Birmingham, Juice Games in Warrington and Venom Games in Newcastle.","2011-10-04 12:23:36.000000",None

The studio worked as a sub-contractor on a number of titles before moving onto its first unique project, Sony-published retro shooter Gravity Crash, in 2008. PS3 and PSP versions released in 2009/2010.

JAW went on to sign a far-reaching contract with Lorne Lanningâs Oddworld Inhabitants to develop properties in the Oddworld franchise, a move Gilray describes as a âturning pointâ. Oddworld: Strangerâs Wrath HD, a conversion of the 2005 original, released in 2010 for PC then a year later for PS3, then followed in 2012 for PlayStation VITA.

Towards the end of development on Strangerâs Wrath HD, the team moved over to start development on what would become Oddworld: New ânâ Tasty for PS4, Xbox One, PS3, VITA, PC, Mac and Linux.

Oddworld: New ânâ Tasty launched in July 2014 on PS4 to critical acclaim, with other platforms arriving in the months following. The title did well to beat its own 12 month sales prediction within 2 months of release.

The team also revisited their title Gravity Crash, by creating a PlayStation VITA version titled Gravity Crash Ultra, released in August 2014. 2014 and 2015 has seen JAW work with new Partners and Clients.

The team are incredibly proud of the titles theyâve worked on, as they have received critical acclaim, achieving metacritic scores in excess of 80.","2011-11-29 07:53:05.000000",http://www.jawltd.com

13304,"Supergiant Games",6,https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload//ughtfknjcbclqblifp5h.png,"Supergiant Games is an American video game development company based in San Jose, California. It was founded in 2009 by Amir Rao and Gavin Simon, and currently consists of employees in San Jose and other locations. Several of its team members were former developers from the Electronic Arts Los Angeles studio, which developed the Command &amp; Conquer series of video games.

Their first game, Bastion, received high critical praise, including being listed among several ""Game of the Year"" lists from game journalists. It was first shown in mid-development at the 2010 Penny Arcade Expo as part of its ""PAX 10"" highlight ten upcoming independently developed games. This attracted several publishers who wanted to help distribute the game, but Supergiant Games found that Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment shared the same vision they had for the game. Supergiant selected them as their publishing partner, enabling them not only to distribute the game to Xbox Live Arcade but as a premiere title during the 2011 ""Summer of Arcade"" promotion.

In March 2013, Supergiant Games announced their next title, Transistor, released on May 20 2014. A promotion video was released March 19. The game features a female protagonist, Red, in a cyberpunk-like city, who had gained possession of a powerful weapon that she is nearly killed for possessing. The game features a similar isometric viewpoint to Bastion. Transistor was similarly met with critical acclaim with an average critic score of 83 on Metacritic.","2013-03-25 15:23:58.484999",http://www.supergiantgames.com

13398,"Turn 10 Studios",12,https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload//qtkg089mtfwctcvn480m.png,"Located in Redmond, Washington, Turn 10 Studios is the creator of the Forza Motorsport franchise. 

Turn 10 is a subdivision of Microsoft Studios, established in 2001 as a first-party racing game developer. Turn 10 Studios began working on the original Forza Motorsport to fill the void of simulation racing games on the Xbox console. With an emphasis on driving mechanics and the newest features of Xbox LIVE, the original Forza Motorsport was released in May of 2005 to much critical acclaim and community support. 

Building off its success, Turn 10âs team immediately began working on a sequel intended to be released on Microsoftâs new Xbox 360 console. Forza Motorsport 2 was released in May of 2007, pushing the boundaries of User Generated Content (UGC) with a robust livery editor and online Auction House, giving casual players new options for expressing their creativity on and off the track. With new online tools, the Forza community thrived as painters, tuners, seller, and racers shared their creations via Forzamotorsport.net. 

In late 2007, Turn 10 Studios began an intense development process for the next Forza installment. Our most ambitious project to date, Forza Motorsport 3 boasted enhanced graphics, driving physics, and UGC. Turn 10 released the game in October 2009 to critical and commercial success. 

Released in October of 2011, Forza Motorsport 4 brought even more excitement to the franchise with Kinect integration, including the stunning Autovista experience. With hundreds of cars rendered in stunning detail, and new tracks to hone skills on, Forza Motorsport 4 was another resounding success for Turn 10 Studios. 

With Forza Horizon, the Forza universe expanded to the open road. Action racing put the player in an open world that demands driving skill and rewards driving style. With lots to explore and a cutting-edge soundtrack to compliment the scenery, Horizon was an evolution of the authentic Forza experience.
 
In 2013, Turn 10 released Forza Motorsport 5, the first Forza Motorsport game to appear on the newest Xbox console, Xbox One. Featuring astonishing graphics and cutting-edge features like cloud-powered Drivatar opponents, Forza Motorsport 5 is a landmark racing game that defined the next generation of consoles and continues to appeal to Xbox fans across the world.
 
Forza Horizon 2 was released in 2014, featuring the wide-open spaces of Southern Europe to explore in hundreds of realistic, real-world cars. With a full day-night cycle and dramatic weather effects, Forza Horizon 2 was hailed by fans and critics alike for its beautiful visuals and emphasis on pure fun. In March 2015, Turn 10 released Forza Horizon 2 Presents Fast &amp; Furious, a standalone expansion for Forza Horizon 2, inspired by the Fast &amp; Furious film series and featuring many of the cars from Universalâs blockbuster action film, Furious 7.","2013-06-25 16:58:17.427999",http://www.forzamotorsport.net/en-us/turn10

Pluto 13 GmbH was founded in 2002 by employees and management of Piranha Bytes Software GmbH. Piranha Bytes Software GmbH was itself founded in 1997 and later (1999) turned into a 100% subsidiary of Phenomedia AG, a company listed on Germanyâs Neuer Markt stock exchange. In 2001 the first GOTHIC game was released to the public. In May 2002 Phenomedia AG went into insolvency proceedings due to irregularities for which several former group managers (not Piranha Bytesâ management!) have been tried for in a German criminal court of law.

It was therefore decided to make a clean cut and negotiate an MBO with the administrator, which was concluded in September 2002. Pluto 13 GmbH was founded and major assets, trademarks and most staff were transferred to the new company. One of the four original founders remained with the team in a leading position.

Pluto 13 GmbH is a privately owned limited liability corporation under German law, all shares are held by staff and management.

In the last years we gathered ample experience developing award-winning games, employing highly optimized workflows and making a name for ourselves in the games industry.
Founded in January 2011, we evolved from casual to core game development with currently 19 team members.
We love great games, we value quality, passion and art, and our products are meant to reach the masses.

There are three pillars that build the foundation of our studio:
Creativity - Taking a fresh approach to existing genres with instantaneously recognizable art styles.
Production - Always delivering on time and on budget. Even for first-time projects and challenges.
Technology - Consecutively enhancing our efficiency and product quality via modularized in-house framework.

If we do it, we do it right â including work-for-hire projects, which will receive as much love as our own. If we agree to work on them.
We are consistently growing by accessing multiple game design universities and freelance professionals, identifying the best talent only.
Mimimi Productions is a registered developer for all relevant platforms and is working with the Unity 3D-engine since 2010.","2013-07-01 04:33:49.572999",http://www.mimimi-productions.de/

System 3 stands proud as the last surviving British Independent Publisher from those grass roots years

2012 marked System 3â²s 30th anniversary, a monumental occasion in the companyâs long and fruitful history!

From early 8-bit Commodore 64 and the Sinclair Spectrum machines, through the days of 16-bit Commodore Amiga and Atari ST formats right up to and beyond the phenomenal Sega, Nintendo, PlayStation and Xbox console boom, the company has brought a unique gaming style to new formats as and when they enter the market.

In the mid 1980â²s International Karate was a huge hit, attaining global recognition as the first game from a European publisher to hit the number one spot in the prestigious US Billboard Charts. What followed is true gaming folklore. Hailed as the most original series of games for a generation The Last Ninja and Last Ninja 2 set the standard in arcade adventuring, hitting number one around the world and garnering the company with armfuls of awards by the turn of the decade. Making up the final part of the historic trilogy Last Ninja 3 became the only game to date to be awarded a 100% review in Commodore User Magazine.

As the market began to lean more and more towards licenses and franchises, Myth: History in the Making, Putty Squad and Constructor continued to showcase System 3â²s development ethos for producing truly original gaming experiences for everyone.

In 2007 System 3 entered into an agreement with Ferrari, the worlds most prestigious and instantly recognisable car brand. With one eye on producing a super-slick original racing game befitting the name and another on developing the definitive race game engine, Ferrari Challenge: Trofeo Pirelli was born.

A critical success and widely regarded as the best racing simulation available today, the game has gone on to form the bedrock of ongoing plans to continue to produce original games for all genres and, in particular, technically superior video racing games for many years to come.

In 2010 System 3 began the process of welcoming back one of its most popular IPs; Putty. Putty Squad is set for release on PS3, Vita and Apple formats in 2013.

System 3 produces games for the key hardware platforms including; Nintendo Wii, Nintendo DS, Nintendo 3DS, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, PlayStation Portable, PSP go, PlayStation Vita, Xbox 306, Windows-based personal computers and mobile phone applications.","2013-07-17 11:00:25.894999",http://www.system3.com/

The company is probably best known for Moon Patrol, the famous scrolling shooter R-Type and the earliest beat 'em up, Kung-Fu Master. They have been a popular developer in Japan with games like Photoboy for the PC Engine and In the Hunt for the arcades, Sega Saturn, PlayStation, and PC. Irem is also known for making their arcade games extremely difficult, and most of them feature a dip switch that allows you to play a ""no death mode"" as a result, in order to allow gamers to be able to complete their tough games.

As a result of the 2011 TÅhoku earthquake and tsunami, Irem canceled the majority of its remaining video game projects, including Zettai Zetsumei Toshi 4: Summer Memories and Poncotsu Roman Daikatsugeki Bumpy Trot 2. Irem re-focused to become primarily a slot-machine and pachinko developer, the industry it was in before turning to video games. Its video game division was dissolved in April 2011 and many Irem designers, including producer Kazuma Kujo, gathered to form a new company called Granzella to continue creating games.","2013-07-25 20:06:37.569999",http://www.irem.co.jp

All three of them previously worked together at Infogrames as a part of the internal Eden development group. By forming the company, Eden became independent. The studio initially signed contracts with Infogrames for two V-Rally games, but asserted its independence by signing a publishing agreement with Electronic Arts in 1999.

In May 2002 the company was sold to the Infogrames Group (that later became Atari), which already held 19.8% of the company's shares. In September 2003 the name was changed to Eden Games S.A.S.

Most recently, the studio is known for the Alone in the Dark reboot (2008) and the Test Drive Unlimited series.","2014-01-26 09:49:20.664999",http://www.edengames.com

The studio consisted largely of existing Capcom R&amp;D talent, who had formed the company (then called Studio 9) to give themselves greater executive control (and thus creative freedom), like Sega's semi-autonomous studios in the early 2000s. The studio focused largely on creating new intellectual property rather than sequels. When these failed to perform on par with Capcom's more popular series, Capcom attempted to merge the studio back into their internal R&amp;D. Those at the studio chose instead to leave the company, and Clover was dissolved.

Some of the key members of Clover founded Seeds Inc., a new development group that merged with ODD Incorporated in October 2007 to form PlatinumGames, which has since built up a staff composed of former Clover staff. Other members (including the art director of Åkami) went to join Ignition Entertainment at their Tokyo development studio.""","2014-01-26 09:54:21.463999",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clover_Studio

14638,"NIS America",6,https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload//kltxrldhcs8xsum9gs7b.png,"Nippon Ichi Software was founded in September 1991 in Gifu Prefecture, Japan, as an entertainment software company. It was relocated and reincorporated on July 12, 1993. Since then Nippon Ichi Software, Inc. has grown into an international company focused on creating video game products across modern console platforms. NIS America, Inc. subsidiary of Nippon Ichi Software, Inc. of Japan, established its North American operations on December 24, 2003. Based in Santa Ana, California, NIS America, Inc. handles operations including localization, marketing, and publishing of Nippon Ichi titles. The first game to be released in North America by NIS America was Phantom Brave.

NIS America was the result of the company's wish to focus on international publication of their works in the U.S., given the increased popularity of their titles. Prior to the creation of this subsidiary, NIS software titles that appeared in the U.S. were localized and distributed by outside publishers. Notable examples would be Disgaea: Hour of Darkness, published in North America by Atlus and in Europe by Koei, La Pucelle, published in North America by Mastiff Inc, and Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure which was also published in North America by Atlus. The publisher has become a somewhat of a well-known presence in the North American market, having won RPGLand's ""Stateside Publisher of the Year Award"" in 2009.","2014-02-08 01:28:16.460000",http://nisamerica.com/

16148,"Ultimate Play the Game",26,https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload//uer8wf2ungnylqzkjpwd.png,"Ultimate Play The Game (often shortened to Ultimate) was a video game developer in the 1980s. 
Ultimate released a series of successful games for the Sinclair ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, BBC Micro, MSX and Commodore 64 computers from 1983 until its closure in 1988. Ultimate are perhaps best remembered for the big-selling titles Jetpac and Sabre Wulf, each of which sold over 300,000 copies in 1983 and 1984 respectively, and their groundbreaking series of isometric arcade adventures utilising a technique termed Filmation. Knight Lore, the first of the Filmation games, has been retrospectively described in the press as ""seminal ... revolutionary"".

By the time of the label's last use in 1988 on a retrospective compilation, Ultimate had evolved into Rare, and moved on to developing titles for Nintendo consoles. Rare was purchased by Microsoft in 2002 for US$377 million, a record price for a video game developer, and now develops exclusively for Microsoft's Xbox One console. In 2006, Rare revived the ""Ultimate Play The Game"" name for an Xbox Live Arcade remake of Jetpac named Jetpac Refuelled.","2014-10-16 10:39:24.302000",None

We grow up on playing retro games. Our purpose is to pursue and to evolve more the fun of them.

NIGORO is not a game company. To be exact, NIGORO is a game development department of ASTERIZM corporation. The games are developed by NIGORO members have released as a brand name âNIGOROâ. We may also sell on behalf of other game developers. In that case, they have released as a brand name âASTERIZMâ.
It is hard to understand. lol.

In the United States, indie Games has considerable demand, and many developers have been successful. In Japan, when it comes to a genre called âDOUJINâ, there are successes. On the other hand when it comes to a genre called âINDIEâ, there are few successes. On top of that, indie games themselves are not so popular.

In that circumstances, we have the ambition to be successful Japanese indie games and hope to boost Japanese indie game development field which like-minded people. We are working with such thoughts. Thanks.""","2014-10-29 11:01:08.835999",http://nigoro.jp/en/

Then came Basement Crawl and its reimagination  in the form of BRAWL, which steered Bloober Team back to its roots - to horror games. The company has worked directly with companies like Nintendo, Microsoft, or Sony.
Layers of Fear (2016) was the first game from Bloober Teamâs new horror portfolio, sealing the new vision of Bloober Team for the years to come.","2015-01-16 13:33:56.897000",http://www.blooberteam.com/

Project Reality was begun 11 years ago with the objective of bringing a greater sense of reality to EAâs Battlefield franchise style of gameplay. It is still active 10 years later and has won many accolades including being inducted into Mod DBâs mod Hall of Fame in December 2010. The core of Offworld Industries has been working together for the better part of a decade on and off, and have finally reached the point where they were confident they could make it on their own and development standalone games.","2015-04-07 06:13:28.107000",https://press.joinsquad.com/

18285,"Wisdom Tree",18,https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload//wakhngvfc6hkvplxxok6.png,"Wisdom Tree is a Christian gaming company originally called Color Dreams. They basically took some of their Color Dreams games and added Bible themes. These games didn't just rip off their own games. Eventually, Nintendo found out about all these games being made without their permission. When the SNES was released, they installed a lockout chip allowing only licensed games to play. Wisdom Tree got around this by creating the Wolfenstien clone, Super Noah's Ark 3D. by inserting a licensed game into the top of it, it overrode the lockout chip.","2015-06-16 07:18:57.901999",http://www.wisdomtreegames.com/

19842,"Paradox Development Studio",6,https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload//tmgoxhnyjjmlvxvqyadt.png,"Paradox Development Studio is based on the heritage of the Swedish board game company Target Games, and has been a game developer of PC-focused grand strategy games since 1995, including the Europa Universalis, Hearts of Iron, Crusader Kings, and Victoria series. The company continued to create PC games and in 1999, the company was divided into two separate entities: Paradox Interactive, which focused on creating grand strategy games for PC, and Paradox Entertainment, which focused on creating board and role-playing games.

In January 2012, the company divided yet again into two companies, becoming Paradox Interactive and Paradox Development Studio. Paradox Interactive became the game publisher focused on PC games of various genres and Paradox Development Studio became the game development studio focused on grand strategy games.

The game development studio was one of the first video game developers to create games in the grand strategy genre, and most of the games the studio has developed falls into that category. Grand strategy games are historical strategy games that usually cover the entire world map and include elements such as economy, diplomacy and warfare.","2015-12-08 15:06:14.125999",https://www.paradoxplaza.com/

What allows this transtion is our new game service, BscotchID, now integrated into our core portfolio on iTunes and Google Play.","2015-12-14 08:53:04.394999",http://www.butterscotch-shenanigans.com/

&#13;
Michael Peiffert was a senior art director in the web design industry. In the past, he has won several prizes for his work on user-experience and design. In 2010, he founded his one-man company, Mi Clos Studio, and began his career in the game design industry. His first game was released in 2011: Space Disorder. Michael loves Doom and is the 15th best player in France on the Xbox Live Street Fighter IV. FibreTigre has been writing interactive fiction for 12 years and has released a couple of serious/experimental games. He has written about video games in French publications, such as Wired France. FibreTigre loves turn-based games such as Gladius and X-Com and has finished both Dark Souls. Michael and FibreTigre met twice, first when Michael was pitching Space Disorder at a lecture, then when FibreTigre made a lecture about Gamebooks and their influence on modern video games. Since they both loved sci-fi, they agreed to embark on the Nomad for the Out There adventure. During Out There, FibreTigre crafted the text and the game design, whereas Michael took care about everything else: coding, art direction, graphic assets and communication. They created Out There with nearly no budget, working part time. Difficult times, but these difficulties reflected in the harsh perils and loneliness the players can experience with Out There.&#13;

A few drinks later, it didn't matter anymore. Joar Renolen, a talented composer and longtime friend of Martin's, joined the team shortly after.""","2016-05-06 11:26:24.832999",None

The focus, she decided, would be games with emphasis on narrative and simple but robust design. She already had a small part time project, Capitals, running with Sebastian Alonzo and Markus HellstrÃ¶m - but the time had come to make games with all engines running on full throttle. 

Talecore Studioâs goal is to create experiences that engage the heart and challenge the brain - experiences that make you feel and think. The studio will not hesitate to deal with heavy subjects and more mature themes than you might be used to from other games. Just like literature and movies can range from comedy via the very dark to the thought-provoking, so should games. It is simply a part of the industry showing that it is growing up.","2016-05-21 04:34:27.293999",http://www.talecore.com

Being in that kind of business never really put any restrictions what the targeted market or the audience is. Kupi Key was formed in 2012, by one person, Jurica Å inko, being a little genius he is, he soon started being very successful and he realized that way more opportunities lie in making his own video games. In May 2015. he took a risk and formed Just1337 Studio, putting together 4 friends, on a mission to create their own video games, that they all so love and on who they grow up. The learning process, making the team work together, understanding what the market standards are, took about 5 months, and in October 2015 the first game was ready for release. Since then, some things of course changed and the team grow even bigger. The studio is focusing more on 2D games for now, with a big appetite to go into 3D in time. That being said, both games that this studio has behind them are 2D, each evolving in a incredible pace and complexity. Big things lay in front of us, so stay tuned.","2016-05-25 08:32:55.719000",http://www.just1337.com/

24450,"Ghost Ship Games",0,https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload//hpxi77gdhgolm0yhdmu2.png,"Ghost Ship Games is a Danish game development studio, founded in the spring of 2016 by a group of veteran game developers after years of working together. Our common portfolio counts titles such as Prince of Persia, Far Cry, Kane & Lynch, Total Overdose, Game Globe, Max: The Curse of Brotherhood, Freedom Fighters and The Division. 
 
Our motto is simple: Co-op First. The goal is to take co-operative gameplay to the next level and to make great games, focused on the core gamer.  
 
We want to turn Ghost Ship Games into a solid game studio, able to compete with other mid-size game studios on Steam, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. As a small, new developer we will have to pick our projects with care, but together we have the skill, the experience, and the passion to create something truly fantastic.","2017-02-13 11:35:12.437000",http://www.ghostship.dk
